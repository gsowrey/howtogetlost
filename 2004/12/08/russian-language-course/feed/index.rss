		<description><![CDATA[I thought the idea was for a Chinese course, and blunder our way through 
Russia? Given that we can read Cyrillic and do rough translations, I think 
that would be good enough, eh? I&#039;d rather worry more about Chinese, where

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I thought we agreed on Russian since there are several dialects of 
Chinese that we&#039;d be exposed to in China. Fine, well, Mandarin costs $205 
and meets from 7 - 9pm on Tuesdays. Same time frame. Maybe I&#039;ll take both?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm. It&#039;s obvious that we had too many beers the last time we discussed 
this. ;)

There are several, yes, but Mandarin is the official dialect. I know 
that&#039;s not going to totally cover our asses, but I think I&#039;d like to walk 
into this a little more aware of the situation than not. 

Given the choice between the two, I&#039;d lean more towards Mandarin (also 
handy in Chinese restaurants!). 

Besides, weren&#039;t you the one who suggested that French was also widely 
spoken in Russia? ;)  (I still wonder if that&#039;s actually true.)]]></description>
