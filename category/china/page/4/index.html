<div class="storycontent">
<p>Lest I neglect a wonderful place in Shanghai. One of our first stops was the <a href="http://www.shanghaimuseum.net">Shanghai Museum</a>. This is a fairly new place, having only opened in the last couple of years. And its exhibitions are among some of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen. The building itself is quite nice to look at (as are many of the buildings in Shanghai), but the collections are even better. </p>
<p>Take the jade exhibit, for example. Many museums I&#8217;ve been in (and certainly ones on this trip) would dump a lot of it in one room, without much care for organization or progression. At the Shanghai Museum, they take great care to take you from the early days of jade carving, some 5,000 years ago, to the more recent history of pre-1911. You can actually see how jade carving evolved. The Museum also took care to explain the various epochs and what made them significant. </p>
<p>The same goes for their pottery exhibit, which features the early clay works to celandon (pre-porcelain) to the blue-and-white porcelain that we all came to call &#8220;china&#8221;, and works beyond that. It&#8217;s impressive stuff. The Museum even produces a chart of broken pottery pieces that identifies the different styles and eras. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03649.jpg" width="300" alt="China porcelain at the Shanghai Museum"></a> </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03650.jpg" width="300" alt="A close-up of pottery detail"></a> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also painting and calligraphy that&#8217;s displayed under motion-sensor lights. You get close, the lights turn up; otherwise, they&#8217;re kept dim to preserve the paintings. Call it what you will, but someone here really knew how to make a good museum. </p>

<h2 id="post-137"><a href="../../../../2005/06/04/the-shanghai-maglev-train/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: The Shanghai MagLev Train">The Shanghai MagLev Train</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>A few years back, someone got the idea that China really needed to showcase its technical know-how, and put forth the idea of building one of the most technically-complex things for commercial use: a MagLev train. Magnetic levitation, while not a new idea, is an expensive proposition. Few countries have even attempted it (the major attempts have been primarily Germany and Japan, with smaller ones in England, the United States, and France), and only China has created a commercial system. At a cost estimated at $1.2 billion (US, I presume). This is for a 30km link that runs from Pudong airport to Shanghai&#8217;s state-of-the-art subway line, but not even close to the downtown core. </p>
<p>The technology was bought from the Germans, who were instrumental in getting the line up and running. To be sure, the Germans got a lot out of creating an actual, operating MagLev line. The line was officially opened 31 December 2002, and went into operation in early 2003. </p>
<p>We were told by Noah and Justin that we had to check this puppy out. With it being so close to our hotel, how could we resist? </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03655.jpg" width="300" alt="The train at Longyang Rd. Station"></a> </p>
<p>The station is on two levels &#8212; the track is elevated (for a variety of reasons). A return ticket is 80RMB, which is only about US$10. For the trip, this is quite reasonable. Naturally, the line runs at a loss, but in the communist economy, that&#8217;s not really a concern. </p>
<p>The train is about 100 metres long, and all the cars are permanently linked &#8212; you can see from one end of the train to the other on the inside. Unlike some other types of MagLevs, the Shanghai system does not have wheels for lower speeds &#8212; it&#8217;s either suspended or rests on skids. You know when the train is about to leave when you start feeling like floating. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03656.jpg" width="300" alt="Cockpit of the train"></a> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of noise &#8212; important, since there are no moving parts (at least as far as the drive system is concerned). Noise is generally from vibration, assumedly coming from the changing in polarity that drives the train forward. Acceleration is smooth and very fast &#8212; you&#8217;re going over 200 km/h before you know it. But that&#8217;s not even half the upper speed &#8212; the train tops out at 431 km/h. The blur outside your window is almost frightening. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03657.jpg" width="300" alt="Going this fast is almost scary"></a> </p>
<p>The total 30 km trip to the airport takes only 7 minutes. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03659.jpg" width="300" alt="The train arrives at Pudong Airport station"></a> </p>
<p>If only someone had the wherewithal to build one of these puppies between Calgary and Edmonton. But I doubt anyone would ever make money from it. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So we found out today at lunch that our hotel is on what was farmland barely a decade ago. The Pudong area of Shanghai was nothing but agriculture until China opened up a scant time ago, and BOOM &#8212; a city appeared. Most of it here is new and fresh. It&#8217;s modern on a scale that&#8217;s hard to imagine. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03652.jpg" width="300" alt="Downtown Shanghai"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, we arrived to a wall of heat and humidity. Amy was sure I was going to kill her for making me come here &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t originally wanted to go to Shanghai. For the record, I&#8217;m <em>very</em> happy she convinced me to do so. It&#8217;s amazing here. During the day, it&#8217;s okay. When Shanghai really shines is at night. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03653.jpg" width="300" alt="Nanjing St. at night"></a></p>
<p>Because this is such a modern city, it&#8217;s all about the lights. Nanjing St., a major pedestrian mall, is covered in lights &#8212; you could read a book quite easily in the glow. It&#8217;s packed with people doing all manner of things. It&#8217;s a very neat atmosphere. Down by the Pudong River, you come across some of the older buildings that made Shanghai popular with French, English, Dutch, Portugese, and Spanish traders at the turn of the previous century. Today, they&#8217;re high-class hotels, restaurants, and shops. </p>
<p>Across the river is the massive Shanghai Tower. Amy and I are still trying to understand why the guide books call it &#8220;uninspiring&#8221;. It&#8217;s really quite funky. Though it&#8217;s not as tall as the building that houses the Grand Hyatt hotel. To cross the river, you can either take a boat, or take the Tourist Tunnel &#8212; a short tram line under the river bottom that comes complete with a sound and light show. It&#8217;s cheesy, but fun. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03654.jpg" width="300" alt="Shanghai Tower"></a></p>
<p>I have to admit that I wish we&#8217;d had another day here in Shanghai, but we&#8217;re off for Xian in a little over an hour, and it&#8217;s time to hustle. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>This morning we took the Shanghai Maglev train from Pudong to the International airport. This thing goes up to 431 km/hour and takes only 7 minutes to make the trip. I took some video out the window, so hopefully it turns out. </p>
<p>However, this got me thinking. If we had one of these between Calgary and Edmonton, it would be about a 40 minute trip, more or less. </p>
<p>And if one ran between Moscow and Beijing, well, you could do the entire trip non-stop in about 18 hours. </p>
<p>Cool. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The thing that amazes me about this trip is that each stop gets better and better. I didn&#8217;t think I could enjoy any Chinese city as much as I loved Beijing. </p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Just step out the door of your hotel in Shanghai for the evening. </p>
<p>If you love neon and modern architecture, this is the place to be. </p>
<p>(These photos are pretty blurry because I&#8217;m using my DV as a digital camera. Not so smart. I&#8217;m hoping hoping hoping that my film shots turn out well!)</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0249.JPG' alt='Everybody needs a coke' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Nanjing Road is the main pedestrian mall of Shanghai. It&#8217;s lined with shops, department stores, and of course, neon signs. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0250.JPG' alt='Nanjing Road' width="300"></a></p>
<p>From the waterfront at The Bund, you can get a great view of the new skyline of Pudong area. 12 years ago, this entire riverbank was covered with farmland. Now it&#8217;s all modern high rises, museums, and office buildings. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0252.JPG' alt='Pudong Skyline' width="300"></a></p>
<p>I find it interesting that the Lonely Planet guide called this town &#8220;uninspiring&#8221;. We disagree. Especially at night. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0255.JPG' alt='Uninspired????' width="300"> </a>   </p>
<p>All in all, Shanghai has been an incredible stop. We head off on the train in less than 2 hours for Xi&#8217;An, arriving on the morning of June 8. Two nights there, and then southward. We only have 4 nights booked in Hong Kong, but 6 to figure out, so it&#8217;s looking like the first 2 will be on some beach somewhere. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I have to say, I was a little uncertain of what to expect in China. Mostly because we&#8217;d been told by several Brits and Aussies that we could expect a plethora of unsanitary toilets, pushy and obnoxious people, and horrible trains. </p>
<p>I really have to wonder what on Earth these people saw that was so bad? </p>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve had excellent experiences, even walking into alleyways that are likely more local than tourist. The bathrooms have been clean (mostly, some do have a fairly powerful odour), the food has been mostly outstanding, the people very friendly (&#8220;art students&#8221; aside, we&#8217;ve had a number of people who do just want to talk, even if Amy doesn&#8217;t dig the whole &#8220;practice my English&#8221; thing), and the pushy lines are no worse than trying to get into Future Shop on Boxing Day. </p>
<p>Mind you, we&#8217;ve only just started China, but so far, I have little to complain about. Beijing is also a fairly modern city, which is a nice thing to see amidst all the old buildings, hutongs, and styles that make this metropolis up. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see how Shanghai is&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="post-131"><a href="../../../../2005/06/02/in-the-house-of-mao/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: In the House of Mao">In the House of Mao</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Chalk up another notch on the Dead Commuist Leader Tour. </p>
<p>Today, Amy and I decided to keep things light, since our train leaves tonight for Shanghai. On the list of things to hit: Mao Ze Dong&#8217;s Mausoleum, and the Lama Temple. But first, the House of Mao&#8230;</p>
<p>When Mao finally kicked the bucket in the 70s, he was well into this 90s, something the Chinese are quite proud of (and probably cigarette companies, too, since he chain-smoked something fierce). When Mao died, they couldn&#8217;t simply bury him. He was (and still is) a driving force in Chinese life. So they built him a mausoleum. A big one. Nay, a gigantic one. One that rivals the size of small office buildings. All to house the not-really-decaying body of Mao. </p>
<p>To keep this in perspective, I&#8217;ve also been to Lenin&#8217;s Mausoleum. (That was 16 years ago.) It&#8217;s very small, by comparison &#8212; maybe 10&#215;10 metres. This place is easy 100&#215;100 metres. And four or so stories tall. There&#8217;s considerably more security around it than at Lenin&#8217;s tomb, even during the Soviet era. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03645.jpg" width="300" alt="Mao's Mausoleum"></a> </p>
<p>Because of all the shady people about, and because we couldn&#8217;t find lockers to stow our stuff so we could go inside, Amy and I took turns. Amy went first, because I&#8217;d already seen a dead commie. When I asked her how she felt when she got back, her immediate response was &#8220;respectful&#8221;. </p>
<p>My turn. I had to stand in a line for about 10 minutes before they took a batch of about 40 people around the corner and inside the perimeter to see Mao. You pass by a small booth that sells fresh flowers to lay within the mausoleum building (though it&#8217;s interesting to note that the flowers are &#8220;laid&#8221; in a different room than Mao himself). Then up a set of stairs and into doors that wouldn&#8217;t be any different than an office building&#8217;s. Complete with revolving doors that can&#8217;t really be used all that often. </p>
<p>The atrium features a larger-than-life white marble sculpture of Mao, seated facing north. This is where some kind of trough exists for placing the newly-purchased flowers. (A cynic might suggest that the flowers are collected and taken to the booth for resale.) The line winds around the atrium to the left (east), down the side of the building, then back to the centre to enter the mausoleum chamber. In the centre of the chamber is the Big Guy himself. There&#8217;s a glass wall that separates you from him, and several soliders standing on guard. Mao is contained within a glass sarcophogus, his body draped in what looks to be a Soviet flag. (The hammer and sickle are a symbol of the people, though it would seem more appropriate to use the Chinese flag &#8230; that&#8217;s just me.) </p>
<p>After being hustled through the Room of Mao, you enter into &#8230; a souvenir shop. No, I&#8217;m not kidding. I wish I were making that up. In fact, from the inside of the building all the way until you reach the perimeter again, it&#8217;s all Mao kitch. It&#8217;s tackiness on a level I can&#8217;t even begin to understand. The Soviets were never like this &#8212; Lenin&#8217;s tomb was a simple thing &#8212; even now, the Russians treat it with respect. (Although it&#8217;s said Lenin will be buried in St. Petersburg before too long.) </p>
<p>Seeing Mao was interesting, but not so much as all the grandeur surrounding it. People still worship the man (inasmuch as the officially Communist state allows worship), gathering in lines readily, half of whom buy flowers, for a man most never met and even more whom weren&#8217;t even alive during his tenure as Chairman. The legacy lives on&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>OK, I know this is out of order. But I have an hour to kill and some photos to post so I can clear off my SIM card and take more!</p>
<p>We did end up going to the Forbidden City for a day. The day started off lovely but soon degraded into a thunderstorm. On the way in, we found this cute little park. Oddly quiet and peaceful considering it&#8217;s location in the center of Tourist Beijing. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0235.JPG' alt='Nice Little Park by the Forbidden City' width="300"> </a></p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0236.JPG' alt='Another bridge' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Of course, the park isn&#8217;t the reason to go there, the Forbidden City is. Long kept only as a haven for the Emperor and his favorites, the Forbidden City is now open to anyone who wants to pay for admission with a few yuan instead of one&#8217;s life. </p>
<p>Probably in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, over 50% of the buildings were under scaffolding for renovation. But, we still got to see a fair bit and appreciate the vastness of the compound. </p>
<p>Proof I need a haircut:</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0238.JPG' alt='hey look! i have bad hair!' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Before we got too far, it started pouring. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0239.JPG' alt='The rain begins' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>And pouring. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0240.JPG' alt='More rain' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>By the time we reached the hotel (couldn&#8217;t find a cab), we were soaked to the bone. </p>
<p>Maybe I should have bought one of those umbrellas?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve mentioned, but dripping is not really appropriate in the Pennisula Palace Hotel. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0241.JPG' alt='My favorite store and yours' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Not when they serve dessert that looks like this, anyway. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0242.JPG' alt='Mmmm... dessert' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Or have bathrooms that look like this.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0243.JPG' alt='swanky public bathroom' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Who says you have to rough it all the time????</p>

<p>No, I don&#8217;t want any postcards. </p>
<p>Art show? Already saw it. </p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m not from the United States.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t speak English, at least not well enough for you to practice <i>your</i> English with. </p>
<p>Parlez-vous francais? Non? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m already full, thank you, I don&#8217;t need any more noodles. </p>
<p>Sorry, I am not a smoker, so buying a carton of cigarettes with Chairman Mao on the box wouldn&#8217;t do me much good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll pass on the kite, lighter, thermometer, comb, sun visor, guidebook, and &#8220;authentic&#8221; communist antiques as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m good for water, I have a bottle from the grocery store. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I&#8217;ve been in Beijing almost as long as we were in Mongolia, and yet I feel I&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of things here. We&#8217;ve seen most of the major tourist spots and spent more than a fair amount of hours wandering in the little neighborhoods of food stalls and restaurants that are off the beaten track. We&#8217;ve eaten Beijing Duck (aka Peking Duck), dumplings, kung pao chicken, more dumplings, some barbeque pork buns, more dumplings, more noodles, and potlickers (aka, potstickers). </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been hassled with and haggled with. We&#8217;ve gotten some good deals and been overcharged heinously. </p>
<p>All in all, a most excellent time. </p>
<p>Have I mentioned I love Beijing???</p>
<p>Did I mention that yet? </p>
<p>This morning we headed out to visit Chairman Mao. Dear old Mao, entombed and embalmed and on display some 40 hours per week. They herd you through like cattle, but on the plus side, the entire visit only took about 17 minutes, including the walk around the Mausoleum to the start of the entrance queue. </p>
<p>So now we are at a much cheaper internet cafe&#8230; 10Y for 30 minutes instead of the horrendous 60Y they charge at the hotel. Of course, at the hotel, you get free bottled water. <i>Insert eye roll</i></p>
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m not knocking the bottled water. It&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s not worth 50Y! </p>
<p>After this quick post and some email, we are off to the <a href="http://www.orientalplaza.com/en/malls/index.html">Oriental Plaza Mall</a> to buy a suitcase (for me) and possibly a duffle for Geoff. Yes, a suitcase. With wheels. </p>
<p>I decided that I&#8217;ve spent far too much on postage costs mailing stuff home, so a nice little suitcase will do the trick at this point. I&#8217;m close enough to home that schlepping it all over isn&#8217;t such a daunting process. Plus, I like the souvenir shopping. As Martha would say, it&#8217;s a good thing. </p>
