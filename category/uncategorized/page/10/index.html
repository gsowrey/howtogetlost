<div class="storycontent">
<p>Ah, Irkutsk, the &#8220;Paris of Siberia&#8221; as I&#8217;ve heard it called. So far, it&#8217;s living up to it&#8217;s name. The architecture is a cool mix of victorian-in-shambles and Stalinist/Constructionist concrete. There are great looking restaurants, lots of people out and about, and the internet cafes are easy to find. Additionally, it LOOKS like we&#8217;ll be able to post all the photos from the past week! Just have to go back to the hostel and grab our cameras this evening.</p>
<p>Speaking of the hostel, three phone calls and many blocks later, we found it and are checked in. I suspect Geoff is explaining the process for finding an unmarked door on the backside of a building. Not as easy as you might think. </p>
<p>The plan for this afternoon is decidedly low key. It&#8217;s already 3:30pm, both of us feel pretty crummy, so we&#8217;re going to head back to the hostel after a bit more internet time and just relax for a few hours. Right now I feel a bit headachey and lightheaded. A nap might be just the thing. A nap and a wee bit of knitting.</p>
<p>In the evening, we can go back to the train station to retrieve our bags. After that, I suspect we&#8217;ll be fighting over the shower.</p>
<p>I am so glad to be staying put for a few days. Well, two nights and a morning. But the great thing is that our next train ride is only 6 hours or so, all during the day, and in a 4 berth compartment which should be fine, even if it is on a train more like the one from Kazan to Yekaterinburg than the nice #10 and #28 we had earlier.</p>

<h2 id="post-87"><a href="../../../../2005/05/14/amy-communications-superstar/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Amy, communications superstar!">Amy, communications superstar!</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So, sitting in the only internet connection in all of Krasnoyarsk (or seemingly so), Amy dove into one of the sites she used extensively for planning this trip: <a href="http://www.poezda.net">poezda.net</a>. There, she found that there was a train hitting Krasnoyarsk (roughly translated as &#8220;ass end of Russia&#8221;) in about an hour and a half from then, which could whisk us away from the cultural wasteland that is Krasnoyarsk. </p>
<p>(As a note, someone actually told us that Krasnoyarsk is the cultural centre of Siberia. This leads me to conclude that the person is lying or vastly misinformed, or Siberia has no culture whatsoever. Personally, I find the latter very hard to believe.)</p>
<p>Arriving at the train station, we bolted upstairs to the ticket office and tried to figure out which ticket booth to go to. It took a moment to realize that the four displays showing the lists of trains were for different days. We lined up for the booth selling tickets for &#8230; well, yesterday, now. </p>
<p>Actually, not entirely true. Amy stood in line. I went to get the bags we&#8217;d put in storage for our 18-ish hour foray into town. </p>
<p>Thus began Amy&#8217;s Herculean task: trying to buy train tickets without speaking Russian. Krasnoyarsk is the first place we&#8217;ve been where English is more-or-less unknown. The major catch here was to make sure that Amy and I were in the same compartment. (Neither one of us really wants to get stuck in a room with three drunk Russian men, Amy least of all.) </p>
<p>Try and explain the need for that when you don&#8217;t know Russian, the clerk doesn&#8217;t know English, and our handy phrasebooks don&#8217;t cover that scenario. </p>
<p>But Amy did it. A small notebook became a place for certain keywords (written in Russian) and drawings showing the four bunks in a room. The clerk caught on fairly quickly that we didn&#8217;t speak Russian, so did her best to try and tell us that there weren&#8217;t two bunks in second class &#8212; at least not in the same room. (If you&#8217;ve ever played charades, you&#8217;d probably have done well to decipher what went on.) </p>
<p>I really should have video taped this. Though not nearly as funny as Amy&#8217;s experience trying to buy yarn in Kazan, it was an amazingly frustrating thing to watch &#8212; I still don&#8217;t know how Amy did it. (I doubt I could have taped it, though, since I doubt Russians like having cameras in their ticket areas.) </p>
<p>Finally, after about 10 minutes, we learned that two berths in the same compartment were available &#8212; but in <strong>First Class</strong>. Certainly more money than we would have cared to spend before we left North America. However, the pain we felt in Moscow still lingering, we didn&#8217;t want to rot away in a city neither of us had taken a liking to, and the prospect of moving on earlier to Irkutsk just seemed like a far better solution. </p>
<p>Besides, we&#8217;ve been keeping it pretty lean with expenditures. </p>
<p>The #10 train is quite nice, and the First Class great if for only one reason: no-one else for us to bother, or to bother us. It&#8217;s much more relaxing. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03568.jpg" width="300" alt="Birch trees -- there are a *lot* of these in Siberia"></a></p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03571.jpg" width="300" alt="Amy in the Pectopah (Restaurant) car"></a></p>
<p>So Amy comes to the rescue again, and we&#8217;re now safely in Irkutsk. All we need to do is hook up with our homestay guide. This should be interesting, since his email automatically replied saying he was out of town&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="post-86"><a href="../../../../2005/05/14/sleepy-in-irkutsk/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Sleepy in Irkutsk">Sleepy in Irkutsk</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Yesterday afternoon was frantic. We caught the first bus back to the train depot and hustled to the ticket hall. Over each pair of the 8 or so &#8220;kacca&#8221; windows was an LED display listing upcoming trains and, presumably, the number of vacant seats. One such LED display listed only 1 seat in Kupe (the 4 bunk rooms we&#8217;ve been travelling in thusfar), and another said 8, so we queued up under that Kacca window. </p>
<p>5 minutes later, and with the baggage storage room closure time fast approaching, Geoff went to collect our bags in hope that we&#8217;d get on the train at 13:55. </p>
<p>10 more minutes, and the lady in front of us finished her business, leaving me to try to communicate with the ticket clerk. I had written down the train number, time, date, and number of passengers and had our passports ready. I indicated Kupe and she said something long in Russian that we chose to translate as &#8220;there aren&#8217;t two bunks in the same compartment available in Kupe, but Luxe is available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luxe, another name for S.V., is the &#8220;first class&#8221; sleeper compartment, comprised of 2 beds. We said &#8220;Da!&#8221; and she wrote down the price. 6600 rubles for the two of us, about $150 CAD each. I only had 4000 on me, so I ran around the corner to the Bankomat (ATM) to grab some more cash and then back to the window to purchase our tickets with about 20 minutes to spare.</p>
<p>I fear that this relatively calm entry doesn&#8217;t fully express the sense of panic and adrenaline we experienced yesterday afternoon. We wanted out of Krasnoyarsk, and we wanted out BADLY.</p>
<p>So, with a lot of relief, we were pleased to find a pristine cabin with two bunks instead of four, and a useless flat screen tv. 2 bottles of Baltika later, we were feeling Mo Betta. </p>
<p>We spent the afternoon chatting and daydreaming out the window as Siberia flew by. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d realized how stressful and&#8230; maybe tense isn&#8217;t the right word&#8230; but quiet it can be with strangers who don&#8217;t speak the same language. But with just the two of us, it was time finally to totally relax for 18 hours.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0156.JPG' alt='Train 10 ' width="300"></a></p>
<p>And in 18 hours, I didn&#8217;t knit once. I didn&#8217;t read one page of Dostoyevsky. I just snacked and talked and did a backbend on my bunk and looked out the window at the small villages and backyard farms and birch trees. Lots of birch trees. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0153.JPG' alt='Birches, birches everywhere' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all birch trees. Sometimes you have cute wooden villages between the trees. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0159.JPG' alt='Cute wooden village in the distance' width="300"></a></p>
<p>One of my luxury items that have proven MORE than worth their weight are my loose <a href="http://www.lululemon.com" target="_blank">LuluLemon</a> yoga pants. These have proven to be 24 hour wear on the trains and a comfortable (and comforting) slice of normalcy for me.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0157.JPG' alt='Shameless product shot' width="300"></a></p>
<p>So now we&#8217;re in Irkutsk and needing to find a phone to call Jack about the homestay since we&#8217;re about 9 hours too early still. I just sent him a quick email and it was returned with an autoresponse saying he&#8217;s out of town. But the email isn&#8217;t dated, so I&#8217;m really hoping it&#8217;s old and he forgot to turn it off. Because otherwise, I&#8217;m not sure where we&#8217;d be sleeping/showering tonight. </p>
<p>Oh, a word on that. My last REAL shower was on the morning of May 9 in Moscow. The hotel in Yekaterinburg didn&#8217;t have hot water at night, and I couldn&#8217;t figure it out in the morning, so I did a quick once-over with the spray hose and washed my hair the first night. And I think I washed my hair in the sink a few times in Krasnoyarsk and on the train last night. Still, I am grimy and gross and am really looking forward to a proper shower. Considering I am not much of a camper, it&#8217;s a miracle I can stand myself right now. Or that Geoff can stand me. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s been that long since we&#8217;ve been able to post photos, and unluckily enough, my last post/upload from St. Petersburg failed before I was able to save it. So let&#8217;s try again. If I can remember what happened back on May 6&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/IMGA0105.JPG" alt="Interior of St. Isaac's" width="300"></a></p>
<p>After packing up, we started off the morning at St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral. Beautiful and very opulent interior. The day was rainy and gloomy and I was sore from walking, so Geoff and I split up so he could climb to the belltower and I could stay warm and dry inside. </p>
<p>When I was done checking out the fantastic religious art, I crossed the street to the Astoria Hotel, where apparantly they serve a fantastic High Tea. </p>
<p>And fantastic it was! </p>

<p>Krasnoyarsk. </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s Russian for &#8220;ass end of the country&#8221;. </p>
<p>There ain&#8217;t much here. This is the most utilitarian city I&#8217;ve seen in a very long time. Until just over a decade ago, I couldn&#8217;t have come here &#8212; it was verboten to outsiders. Mostly defence contracts here, and it shows. Toe jam has more character than this place. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also cooler here. Despite being about the same latitude as Ekaterinburg, which was a balmy 25 degrees when we left, it was hovering around 0 this morning as we streaked across the taiga. You could see ice on some of the pools of water. It warmed up quickly, mind you, but we haven&#8217;t warmed up to here. </p>
<p>Amy&#8217;s found a potential early train to get us the heck outta here. Hopefully, it&#8217;ll work. </p>
<p>(A note to those of you traveling across Russia and thinking of stopping here: save yourself the trouble and spend your valuable time in another city.)</p>

<p>Okay, just a general bitch about Russia. </p>
<p>Where the hell are all the internet cafes?? Our guides are out of date &#8212; we accept that. But do we have to traipse around every city for an hour looking for the damn things?! I mean, really, people &#8212; Russia is not that backwards, is it? Even the post offices aren&#8217;t consistent. Some have internet, some have internyet. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see how hard it is in China&#8230; (we&#8217;re only in Ulaan Baatar in Mongolia, and god help us there)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re in Krasnoyarsk.</p>
<p>Went in one museum and the babuska shooed us out the door before we could go in, even though the sign said &#8220;open&#8221;. (We think.)</p>
<p>Heading to the train station now to try to get on faster, earlier train. Otherwise we&#8217;re here until 1:30am tonight. Yikes.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I won&#8217;t post again til Irkutsk!</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Ekaterinburg (Soviet name, a much harsher &#8220;Sverdlovsk&#8221;) is a wonderful little place to spend an afternoon. Assuming you can find your hotel, that is. </p>
<p>After doing our little thing at the post office to try and catch up on postings, Amy and I did about the only thing we had time for: a walking tour. Fortunately, our Lonely Planet book on the Trans Siberian Railway has a walking tour laid out pretty well. It was just a matter for us to walk it. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03564.jpg" width="300" alt="The river in downtown Ekaterinburg"></a></p>
<p>Starting off at the river downtown (actually, the result of a dam that you don&#8217;t even realize is a dam), you head east to a traffic circle, then north to a memorial to soldiers killed in the Afghan conflict. Then you&#8217;re supposed to head a bit west and then north to find a park. Sadly, I took us north, forgetting the west. Result: we walked too far, and missed the park. Amy got us back on track, and soon were sauntering through a rather picturesque little set of trees. </p>
<p>On the opposite side is the site where the Russian Royal Family was murdered on 16 July 1917. The house where their brutual execution took place was actually levelled by Boris Yeltsin (then governor of the area) back in the 70s. It now sports a small iron cross, a marble cross (erected when the Romanov remains &#8212; or, more specifically, what are believed to be the remains) were sent to St. Petersburg for final burial. There is also a rather large church there, now, too (in addition to a much smaller wooden one). Supposedly, the Romanov family are considered saints. Personally, they were ignorant buffoons who didn&#8217;t see the tide coming in until it was too late&#8230; </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03561.jpg" width="300" alt="The iron cross marking the site of the Russian Royal family's murder"></a></p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03562.jpg" width="300" alt="A marble tablet at the same site. I have no idea what it says."></a></p>
<p>Then it was a hasty retreat back to downtown for a bite to eat before running back to the station to catch our train to Krasnoyarsk. But you already know how that went&#8230; </p>

<p>Keep in mind that I&#8217;m writing this from Irkutsk, several days and a lifetime later, but Yekaterinburg is largely a blur to me. We spent our last afternoon &#8211; our only afternoon &#8211; there doing the walking tour from the Lonely Planet guide. I saw a lot of nice buildings, all of which are historic. Can I remember a single one? </p>
<p>Not really. </p>
<p>But I was there. </p>
<p>I have this photo to prove it!</p>
