<h2 id="post-140"><a href="../../04/a-day-in-shanghai/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: A Day in Shanghai">A Day in Shanghai</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The day starts in haze and smog, sun peeking as if through a pin hole in the atmosphere. 30 floors below, cars weave and dodge like bugs picking the best route through the tall grass. I see it before I open my eyes, before I turn over, before I pull back the inefficient curtains. </p>
<p>Later the sun is stronger and so am I, in my uniform of vargo shorts, gree tee, ankle socks and Danish walking shoes. I feel like a swiss hiker in New York City, out of place in a neon landscape. </p>
<p>The air is hot and wet, but kept at bay by a stiff breeze off the river. The haze has pushed back and suddenly I see buildings that were before invisible. We catch a cab out of Pudong, out of the new development and back into old Shanghai, the Shanghai that isn&#8217;t all glass facades and high speed elevators to trendy sushi bars. </p>
<p>In the lanes flanking Nanjing Road, is it impossible to forget China. Rows of shops selling the small, highly specialized selection of merchandise, laundry from upstairs windows. Here you go for nylon rope, here for copper elbow joints, up the road and around the corner for a new tin kettle, for washing powder, for a bag of roasted nuts. </p>
<p>Above the street, you see Europe and colonization in the sculpted details on the brick buildings. Close your eyes and squit and it&#8217;s almost Britain above the street. But it&#8217;s always China, laundry poles strung over the street from upstairs windows, smells of rice dough deep frying, glimpses of old men playing badminton down impossibly small and sunlit alleys. </p>
<p>Dodging an darmy of bicycles, man powered and electric, I cross the street and make my way to the neon consumer pedestrian heaven of Nanjing. Only a block away but several worlds apart, packed with fashionable teens and always-on billboards. At first, Nanjing seems the &#8220;new&#8221; Shanghai; glitsy, glam, glowing. But pause for a moment and look past the 50 foot billboards and the diamonds in shop windows. Above the street, in old apartments, life continues as it did before. </p>
<p>Over there, a shirtless grandfather holds a quilt out the window and gives it a good shake. A few doors down, a young mother bounces her sleepy son. And there, an old woman smokes slowly, one arm dangling out the window. </p>
<p>For me, Shanghai is a puzzle still. IN the city where I live, new and old are concepts only a hundred years apart. New condos blend with 50s bungalows as townhouses blend with brick victorians. The spectrum is short, shades of a single color rather than the entire rainbow. </p>
<p>In Shanghai, twilight comes at 5 and the rainbow really comes to life on Nanjing Road. More neon signs than imaginable, all dancing to separate tunes that together seem to work. A 3 story coke bottle fizzes over, a TDK sign flashes green, red, and white. Further down the road, HSBC and Chevrolet get into the action. </p>
<p>In the last hour, the river of people has swelled with tidal force. It is intoxicating. I drink the smiles, I laugh alone with overheard jokes I can&#8217;t understand. Trolleys ply the street to ferry people from one end to the other. Kids hitch a free ride by grabbing onto the back fender until they&#8217;re spotted. Everywhere is a photo opportunity. Every step opens up some new view that steals my breath, makes my knees wobble. </p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t this why we travel? Aren&#8217;t these the moments we salivate for, go to sleep dreaming of, tear through guidebooks to fuel our imagination for? These are the moments that may fade, may grow weak like my knees, but will never entirely slip away. </p>
<p>More than joining the queue to visit Chairman Mao, more than sloshing through the Forbidden City in a thunderstorm, this I <i>will</i> remember.</p>
<p>Standing against the flow, I look up and see the shot. The perfect shot. Two steps ahead is a concrete post. I hope up onto it and toter for a moment before regaining my balance. Slowly, so slowly, I lift my camera, find the right composition, press the shutter. </p>
<p>Three weeks from now, I will get that photo back from the lab. Bright or dark, too blurry or too cluttered, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I will look at that picture and feel exactly as I did in that moment; launching myself above the sea of faces, above the pulse of life, to try to capture a small fraction of that one perfect day in Shanghai. </p>
<p><i>(The above was written on the train out of Shanghai to Xian)</i></p>

<h2 id="post-138"><a href="../../04/a-couple-of-other-shanghai-sights/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: The Shanghai Museum">The Shanghai Museum</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Lest I neglect a wonderful place in Shanghai. One of our first stops was the <a href="http://www.shanghaimuseum.net">Shanghai Museum</a>. This is a fairly new place, having only opened in the last couple of years. And its exhibitions are among some of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen. The building itself is quite nice to look at (as are many of the buildings in Shanghai), but the collections are even better. </p>
<p>Take the jade exhibit, for example. Many museums I&#8217;ve been in (and certainly ones on this trip) would dump a lot of it in one room, without much care for organization or progression. At the Shanghai Museum, they take great care to take you from the early days of jade carving, some 5,000 years ago, to the more recent history of pre-1911. You can actually see how jade carving evolved. The Museum also took care to explain the various epochs and what made them significant. </p>
<p>The same goes for their pottery exhibit, which features the early clay works to celandon (pre-porcelain) to the blue-and-white porcelain that we all came to call &#8220;china&#8221;, and works beyond that. It&#8217;s impressive stuff. The Museum even produces a chart of broken pottery pieces that identifies the different styles and eras. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03649.jpg" width="300" alt="China porcelain at the Shanghai Museum"></a> </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03650.jpg" width="300" alt="A close-up of pottery detail"></a> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also painting and calligraphy that&#8217;s displayed under motion-sensor lights. You get close, the lights turn up; otherwise, they&#8217;re kept dim to preserve the paintings. Call it what you will, but someone here really knew how to make a good museum. </p>

<h2 id="post-137"><a href="../../04/the-shanghai-maglev-train/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: The Shanghai MagLev Train">The Shanghai MagLev Train</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>A few years back, someone got the idea that China really needed to showcase its technical know-how, and put forth the idea of building one of the most technically-complex things for commercial use: a MagLev train. Magnetic levitation, while not a new idea, is an expensive proposition. Few countries have even attempted it (the major attempts have been primarily Germany and Japan, with smaller ones in England, the United States, and France), and only China has created a commercial system. At a cost estimated at $1.2 billion (US, I presume). This is for a 30km link that runs from Pudong airport to Shanghai&#8217;s state-of-the-art subway line, but not even close to the downtown core. </p>
<p>The technology was bought from the Germans, who were instrumental in getting the line up and running. To be sure, the Germans got a lot out of creating an actual, operating MagLev line. The line was officially opened 31 December 2002, and went into operation in early 2003. </p>
<p>We were told by Noah and Justin that we had to check this puppy out. With it being so close to our hotel, how could we resist? </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03655.jpg" width="300" alt="The train at Longyang Rd. Station"></a> </p>
<p>The station is on two levels &#8212; the track is elevated (for a variety of reasons). A return ticket is 80RMB, which is only about US$10. For the trip, this is quite reasonable. Naturally, the line runs at a loss, but in the communist economy, that&#8217;s not really a concern. </p>
<p>The train is about 100 metres long, and all the cars are permanently linked &#8212; you can see from one end of the train to the other on the inside. Unlike some other types of MagLevs, the Shanghai system does not have wheels for lower speeds &#8212; it&#8217;s either suspended or rests on skids. You know when the train is about to leave when you start feeling like floating. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03656.jpg" width="300" alt="Cockpit of the train"></a> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of noise &#8212; important, since there are no moving parts (at least as far as the drive system is concerned). Noise is generally from vibration, assumedly coming from the changing in polarity that drives the train forward. Acceleration is smooth and very fast &#8212; you&#8217;re going over 200 km/h before you know it. But that&#8217;s not even half the upper speed &#8212; the train tops out at 431 km/h. The blur outside your window is almost frightening. </p>

<p>The total 30 km trip to the airport takes only 7 minutes. </p>

<p>If only someone had the wherewithal to build one of these puppies between Calgary and Edmonton. But I doubt anyone would ever make money from it. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So we found out today at lunch that our hotel is on what was farmland barely a decade ago. The Pudong area of Shanghai was nothing but agriculture until China opened up a scant time ago, and BOOM &#8212; a city appeared. Most of it here is new and fresh. It&#8217;s modern on a scale that&#8217;s hard to imagine. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03652.jpg" width="300" alt="Downtown Shanghai"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, we arrived to a wall of heat and humidity. Amy was sure I was going to kill her for making me come here &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t originally wanted to go to Shanghai. For the record, I&#8217;m <em>very</em> happy she convinced me to do so. It&#8217;s amazing here. During the day, it&#8217;s okay. When Shanghai really shines is at night. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03653.jpg" width="300" alt="Nanjing St. at night"></a></p>
<p>Because this is such a modern city, it&#8217;s all about the lights. Nanjing St., a major pedestrian mall, is covered in lights &#8212; you could read a book quite easily in the glow. It&#8217;s packed with people doing all manner of things. It&#8217;s a very neat atmosphere. Down by the Pudong River, you come across some of the older buildings that made Shanghai popular with French, English, Dutch, Portugese, and Spanish traders at the turn of the previous century. Today, they&#8217;re high-class hotels, restaurants, and shops. </p>
<p>Across the river is the massive Shanghai Tower. Amy and I are still trying to understand why the guide books call it &#8220;uninspiring&#8221;. It&#8217;s really quite funky. Though it&#8217;s not as tall as the building that houses the Grand Hyatt hotel. To cross the river, you can either take a boat, or take the Tourist Tunnel &#8212; a short tram line under the river bottom that comes complete with a sound and light show. It&#8217;s cheesy, but fun. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src="../../../../media/DSC03654.jpg" width="300" alt="Shanghai Tower"></a></p>
<p>I have to admit that I wish we&#8217;d had another day here in Shanghai, but we&#8217;re off for Xian in a little over an hour, and it&#8217;s time to hustle. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>This morning we took the Shanghai Maglev train from Pudong to the International airport. This thing goes up to 431 km/hour and takes only 7 minutes to make the trip. I took some video out the window, so hopefully it turns out. </p>
<p>However, this got me thinking. If we had one of these between Calgary and Edmonton, it would be about a 40 minute trip, more or less. </p>
<p>And if one ran between Moscow and Beijing, well, you could do the entire trip non-stop in about 18 hours. </p>
<p>Cool. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The thing that amazes me about this trip is that each stop gets better and better. I didn&#8217;t think I could enjoy any Chinese city as much as I loved Beijing. </p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Just step out the door of your hotel in Shanghai for the evening. </p>
<p>If you love neon and modern architecture, this is the place to be. </p>
<p>(These photos are pretty blurry because I&#8217;m using my DV as a digital camera. Not so smart. I&#8217;m hoping hoping hoping that my film shots turn out well!)</p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0249.JPG' alt='Everybody needs a coke' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Nanjing Road is the main pedestrian mall of Shanghai. It&#8217;s lined with shops, department stores, and of course, neon signs. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0250.JPG' alt='Nanjing Road' width="300"></a></p>
<p>From the waterfront at The Bund, you can get a great view of the new skyline of Pudong area. 12 years ago, this entire riverbank was covered with farmland. Now it&#8217;s all modern high rises, museums, and office buildings. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0252.JPG' alt='Pudong Skyline' width="300"></a></p>
<p>I find it interesting that the Lonely Planet guide called this town &#8220;uninspiring&#8221;. We disagree. Especially at night. </p>
<p><a href=""><img src='../../../../media/IMGA0255.JPG' alt='Uninspired????' width="300"> </a>   </p>
<p>All in all, Shanghai has been an incredible stop. We head off on the train in less than 2 hours for Xi&#8217;An, arriving on the morning of June 8. Two nights there, and then southward. We only have 4 nights booked in Hong Kong, but 6 to figure out, so it&#8217;s looking like the first 2 will be on some beach somewhere. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I have to say, I was a little uncertain of what to expect in China. Mostly because we&#8217;d been told by several Brits and Aussies that we could expect a plethora of unsanitary toilets, pushy and obnoxious people, and horrible trains. </p>
<p>I really have to wonder what on Earth these people saw that was so bad? </p>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve had excellent experiences, even walking into alleyways that are likely more local than tourist. The bathrooms have been clean (mostly, some do have a fairly powerful odour), the food has been mostly outstanding, the people very friendly (&#8220;art students&#8221; aside, we&#8217;ve had a number of people who do just want to talk, even if Amy doesn&#8217;t dig the whole &#8220;practice my English&#8221; thing), and the pushy lines are no worse than trying to get into Future Shop on Boxing Day. </p>
<p>Mind you, we&#8217;ve only just started China, but so far, I have little to complain about. Beijing is also a fairly modern city, which is a nice thing to see amidst all the old buildings, hutongs, and styles that make this metropolis up. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see how Shanghai is&#8230;</p>
