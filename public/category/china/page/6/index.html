<p>For dinner tonight, we walked about 2 blocks from the hotel to this captivating restaurant. I&#8217;m not even sure what the name would translate to in English&#8230; probably something like &#8220;The dishes captivate the dragon purely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The menu was in Mandarin and English, although the subtitles, as I&#8217;m sure Geoff will elaborate on, left much to be desired.  Somehow, I managed to order 2 beers, a Grouper sauteed in a soy sauce reduction, stir-fryed snow peas, and shrimp with asparagus. </p>
<p>Everything was amazing. </p>
<p>No really. There are no words. </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had Chinese food in San Francisco. I&#8217;ve had it in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, San Jose and Vancouver. And of course, Chicago, Toronto and Calgary. </p>
<p>But really, nothing compares. </p>
<p>Each bite was like a little piece of heaven. </p>
<p>And the Grouper! Oh my. Well. </p>
<p>When we arrived, we noticed the tanks of aquariums on the walls. We didn&#8217;t really give it much thought. But shortly after ordering, the chef came out with a smallish Grouper, still flopping around on the floor in the net. </p>
<p>Gulp. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those animal lovers. I would gladly be a vegetarian, on principal only. In fact, I was a vegeterian for about a year and a half when I lived in California. So actually seeing my meal, live, 15 minutes before consuming it, was a bit tough. Thankfully, the tiny bit of beer I&#8217;d already had helped with that. </p>
<p>And oh, was the fish good. Indescribable. </p>
<p>(This is why I am devoting an entire entry to just dinner.)</p>
<p>Yum.</p>

<p>Hi folks! I&#8217;m back online, finally! While Geoff was able to fire off a quick post our last night in Ulaan Baatar, I decided I was too fed up with the slower-than-dialup connection and cruddy keyboard. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to work on covering the past week and a half with back posts, so you may have to scroll down to read them all. But the new stuff should be fairly obvious.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0224.JPG' alt='Me and Mao' width="300"></a></p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m in China!!!!!</b></p>
<p>Can you believe it? I am pinching myself. I am overjoyed. I love Asia, at least what I&#8217;ve seen of it. And this might be sacrilige, but Beijing reminds me of Japan. I know, I know it&#8217;s really very little like Japan, but it has neon, cool buildings, a weird juxtaposition of modern and traditional, cool soft drinks and amazing food. What more do you need?</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I woke up at the Datong station. I&#8217;d slept about seven hours, but decided that I wasn&#8217;t going to miss crossing this part of China. I was in a new country, and be darned if I&#8217;m not going to witness this! </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03621.JPG" width="300" alt="Datong station"></a></p>
<p>I could&#8217;ve slept longer &#8212; it was pretty dull until we got close to the mountains near Beijing. These are natural barriers over which a somewhat fairly redundant Great Wall was erected. As of yet, Chinese engineers haven&#8217;t made a massive tunnel to speed trains through to the capital. To get there, you need a second engine for the operation. The grade runs to about 4% in a few places, but that&#8217;s not the whole reason. The train actually has to reverse direction like a switchback to make it down the mountain. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why. The second engine then becomes the lead all the way to Beijing. </p>
<p>Finding our hotel usually ends up being a bit of a misadventure. Except in Moscow (where it was hard to miss) and Ulaan Baatar (where we were picked up), we&#8217;ve always had some difficulty finding where we were staying. Sometimes signs aren&#8217;t visible or the map isn&#8217;t clear. In this case, a whole new language, an unclear map, and no signs pretty much conspired to lead us to a nearby Novotel where the French concierge was kind enough to give us specific directions. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03623.JPG" width="300" alt="One of the massive roads near our hotel"></a></p>
<p>The area is nice &#8212; we&#8217;re even near a rather large mall. We partook of an early dinner of noodles (and beer), which ran about Y80, or about CDN$14. I think it was a bit pricey, but Amy contends it was suitable. Having some time, we scooted over to Tiananmen Square to check it out in the setting sun. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03624.JPG" width="300" alt="Amy thoroughly enjoying her first meal in China"></a></p>
<p>We hadn&#8217;t even gotten out of the subway when we bumped into the two folks we talked with at length during our 10 hour crossing of the Russia &#8211; Mongolia border (the girl and I recognized each other in passing; she has a distinctive nose ring). Apparently, we were on the same train, but hadn&#8217;t crossed paths this time. (Instead, we ran into two guys from University of Western Ontario&#8217;s Ivy Business School, who&#8217;d been teaching for three months in Irkutsk.) </p>
<p>Until now, we&#8217;ve been afforded the luxury of being the foreign tourist to completely ignore. Not here. My Canadian shirt (there&#8217;s a maple leaf emblazoned on my left shoulder) attracts a lot of attention. Within moments of trying to take a picture of one of the massive gates (huge buildings, not at all like the one in your chain like fence), a young Chinese couple came up and asked if I was Canadian. He was an English teacher, and wanted to talk to someone who spoke English, I guess. They were wonderful people, even giving us directions to an excellent dumpling restaurant that Amy and I will likely track down tomorrow. (They also told us to avoid the Peking Duck restaurant on our map; it&#8217;s well-known, but a poor value.) </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03625.JPG" width="300" alt="Flag lowering at Tiananmen Square"></a></p>
<p>Later, as we tried to watch the daily flag lowering, a young girl asked Amy and I to pose for a photo with her and a friend. Why do I suddenly feel like Brad Pitt?? About 30 minutes after that, as Amy and I tried to walk back to the subway, <em>another</em> couple asked if we were Europeans (we corrected them) and got into a conversation on how to get to Europe from China by train, and information about the buildings at Tiananmen Square. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re here. We&#8217;re tired, but we&#8217;re here. Now we just need to figure out what to do next.</p>

<h2 id="post-109"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/27/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Crossing the Mongolia &#8211; China border by train">Crossing the Mongolia &#8211; China border by train</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Attention Lonely Planet! You might want to update your information for the next run of your Trans Siberian Railway book, &#8216;cuz a few things have changed. </p>
<p>According to Lonely Planet, the crossing from Mongolia to China takes about seven hours, during which time you can get off, change money, eat at the restaurant, and so on. However, they seem to be only covering the case that you&#8217;re crossing the border during the day. If you take train #24 from Ulaan Baatar to Beijing, things are a little different&#8230;</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ve survived the journey across the Gobi desert. It&#8217;s desolate. It&#8217;s not exactly the most interesting thing to see. Even three days of birch trees was better. You arrive at Zamin Uud, the border city in Mongolia. You&#8217;re about two hours late due to various delays along the line getting there. (Unlike Russia, Mongolia has only a single track through most of its area, and exceedingly few sidings with which to stagger train movements.) Due to late arrival, the exit process runs a bit quicker than the book suggests. </p>
<p>Although there is still the mandatory banging around of cars as the train is arranged for shuttling to Erlian, the Chinese border city. By the time you finally cross the invisible line, it&#8217;s dark. You can&#8217;t even see it. Arriving in Erlian, things happen pretty quickly, again. You&#8217;re still a bit behind schedule, but the shortened process in Mongolia has made up for a large portion of that time. The immigration officers come in, do their thing (one form in triplicate, two others are one-offs), and you&#8217;re tickety-boo. </p>
<p>Almost. </p>
<p>One problem remains (here&#8217;s where the train stuff comes in): the train you&#8217;re on can&#8217;t run in China. Russia, for some odd reason, has a wider track gauge than pretty much everyone else (not counting narrow-gauge railways, that is) &#8212; including China. However, someone planned for this, and the process to adapt the train is fairly simple, if esoteric. </p>
<p>Instead of letting everyone off the train (which is what is supposed to happen &#8212; note to Lonely Planet), the entire train is backed up to a large building about a half kilometre from the station house. The building is itself about 400 metres long and at least 10 metres high (there&#8217;s a large overhead crane in there, though it wasn&#8217;t in use). The cars are divided and set next to tough-looking yellow devices firmly implanted in the thick concrete floor, four per car, one at each corner (about a metre in, actually). </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03618.JPG" width="300" alt="Jacks used to lift cars to change bogies"></a></p>
<p>The car bodies are then jacked up off of the bogies that connect them to the track. (If you&#8217;re not sure what a bogie is, look at a rail car &#8212; the bogie is the part with the wheels and the bracket that holds them in place.) The wide bogies are then pushed out in favour of narrower ones. The car bodies are then lowered back down, and you&#8217;re good to go. The process took about an hour and a half, all told, for the 10 or so cars that had to go through the process. </p>
<p>According to Lonely Planet, you&#8217;re supposed to be allowed to get off and watch. We had to setting to view through dirty windows. Only when the train was reformed and brought back to the station were people finally let off &#8212; 100 yard dashers don&#8217;t run that fast. </p>
<p>Without question the coolest thing, albeit weirdest thing, I&#8217;ve seen done to trains yet.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re in Ulan Ude now, having arrived a bit later last night than scheduled. (Mind you, it took a half hour to walk from the train to the hotel.) </p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be here until <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning, when we leave for Mongolia. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to such an early morning, I&#8217;ll tell you. </p>
<p>Slept mostly on the train, which was about the only way to pass through the pain. It&#8217;s a six and a half hour trip from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude, a distance of no more than 300 km (straight-line, that is). The train needs to take a few bendy twists going through the mountains, pass through a couple of tunnels, and then plods along at an agonizingly slow 50 km/h (estimated). I think we topped out at a few places around 80. </p>
<p>The eastern shore of Lake Baikal was frozen &#8212; ice as far as you could see. The exact opposite of what we&#8217;d seen in Listvyanka two days ago. It looks like it&#8217;s thawing quickly, though, so it shouldn&#8217;t be long before the clear waters show through. </p>
<p>Two of our housemates in Irkutsk (a pair of Aussies) told us two things: 1) that we&#8217;d love Mongolia (something we&#8217;d both strongly suspected), and 2) China would wear us down fast. It&#8217;s chaotic, the toilets are disaster areas (that actually scares us), the &#8220;queues&#8221; aren&#8217;t, and pretty much everything we&#8217;d wanted to see is buried under scaffolding. It seems everyone is upgrading this year. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re just waiting for our tour to start today &#8212; we actually got a guide for here &#8212; and will be back later with more. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Tamara gave me her Christmas present before I left Calgary last night. She<br>
had a theme going! It was very cool. There were three wrapped packages,<br>
which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Luggage tag with a Canadian flag</li>
<li>Travel sewing kit (especially useful when you only have four changes<br>
of clothes)</li>
<li>One of those funky wallet-belts to keep things close and personal</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=24&amp;rgnID=4&amp;rgn=Europe&amp;countryID=280&amp;country=Russia&amp;">Lonely Planet&#8217;s Russian Phrase</a> book</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/078948434X/qid=1103831301/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7687249-2278348?v=glance&amp;s=books">Hong Kong tourist book</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, I feel like a schmuck roommate/friend for giving her a t-shirt<br>
and a couple of movie passes. Man, she <em>totally</em> outdid me this year. </p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
