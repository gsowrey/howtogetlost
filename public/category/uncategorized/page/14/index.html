<p>Why is it that British buildings are so freaking hot?</p>
<p>My bag finally appeared at the hotel last night. Clean underwear is a good thing, indeed. I&#8217;ve had it back barely 10 hours and have turned it back to British Airways for our flight to St. Petersburg. <em>Sigh</em></p>
<p>Britain is a neat country, and I look forward to seeing it again sometime. But for now, the adventure continues.</p>
<p>Keeping it short. This internet kiosk has a really crappy keyboard!</p>

<h2 id="post-52"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/01/a-little-more-of-london/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: A little more of London">A little more of London</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The first run of business today was food at Paddington Station. As it&#8217;s Sunday, not everything was open, and what few things were open weren&#8217;t wholly attractive. One thing I have to ask about British cuisine &#8212; what&#8217;s with all the freaking mayonnaise? Most of the sandwiches really didn&#8217;t appeal to me (I&#8217;m sure the &#8220;cheese and spring onion&#8221; is tasty, but it looks like something went bad and is seeking recognition as a sentient organism). I ended up with a fairly tasty pesto pasta salad. </p>
<p>We stopped in Oxford Circus so Amy can stock up on even MORE knitting stuff (I think she might be more obsessed with knitting than I am about trains &#8212; but that&#8217;s just me) before we found our way to the British Museum (not far away). </p>
<p>Big. REALLY big. Didn&#8217;t see much, though, as I realized partway in the door that if I see everything during this trip, I&#8217;ll be bored when I&#8217;m back here with Alex next time. So I&#8217;m seeing enough to whet the appetite and hunger for more. Which won&#8217;t be hard. No St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral this time, though that had been a goal of mine. I can live with that. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03531.JPG" width="300" alt="The Rosetta Stone, anda lot of people crowding around it"></a></p>
<p>Then to Coventry Garden Market. Lots of shopping. I lost Amy there, as she wanted to shop more, and I felt a compelling need to stay <em>out</em> of the stores. I eventually decided to endulge my trainspotting habits and went to check out Waterloo Station. I tell ya &#8212; these Brits know how to build train stations. It&#8217;s truly a shame that we North Americans have turned our back so much on train travel. It&#8217;s not only more efficient, it really is a much better way to get around. </p>
<p>I also made a stop at the Paddington Underground station (Circle/District Line) for a photo &#8212; a beautiful station. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re back at the internet cafe we hit last night &#8212; Amy managed to get a computer that recognizes our cameras, so now there are more images. I&#8217;ve only taken a few with my small camera, which is becoming painfully aware that there&#8217;s not much here to see. So I&#8217;ll work on more pictures to post. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Amy and I are off for dinner. Given that all I&#8217;ve eaten is the pasta salad, I need something a tad more filling now. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;re off to St. Petersburg for four days. We&#8217;re leaving behind the comfort of English-speaking familiarity for the foreignness of the industrialized Second World. </p>
<p>I just hope I have my backpack&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0028.JPG' alt='at the internet cafe' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Ah, London. Oxford Street. Covent Garden. Great window shopping everywhere!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that the hot item for spring seems to be a flouncy white skirt, hitting just below the knee. If I had my camera handy, I could have nabbed a street shot of five different women on one corner, all wearing near-identical skirts. Pity!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a complete clumsy klutz, so I decided to leave white for more pristine skinny girls. Instead, I picked up a pair of black fishnet and lace legwarmers that look absolutely awesome as armwarmers. (And they weigh next to nothing so they&#8217;ll be my one fashionable item in my backpack!)</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0037.JPG' alt='My nifty arm/legwarmers' width="300"></a></p>
<p>But enough about shopping. </p>
<p>Today we started off at The British Museum, mainly to see the Rosetta stone and check out a bit of the Egypt galleries. I&#8217;ve been twice before, but it was always good to pop in for a bit. </p>
<p>After the museum, we headed to Covet Garden, where Geoff quickly buggered off, terrified of the prospect of shopping of any kind. Good for me, it left plenty of time to pop into shops like Monsoon, French Connection, and even Urban Outfitters. Lush has even made it&#8217;s way to the UK. I guess it&#8217;s just not in the USA yet, aside from one or two spots. </p>
<p>My feet (and my wallet) held up pretty well until 4 when I headed back towards the hotel. Around Oxford Circus, I overheard three (obviously gay) men on the train mention that Regent&#8217;s Park was quite beautiful, so I spontaneously decided to hop off the train and head there for an hour of sunning and knitting. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0033.JPG' alt='Regent\&#039;s Park' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>All too soon, we are leaving England tomorrow morning first thing, for a 4 hour flight to Russia. And so, the adventure begins!</p>

<p>The backpack is actually here. However, it&#8217;s still at Heathrow (or at least was an hour ago) going through customs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy I didn&#8217;t pack any foodstuffs aside from the dehydrated soup. A jar of peanut butter might set off import alarms. </p>

<h2 id="post-49"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/01/the-tale-of-the-missing-backpack/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: The Tale of the Missing Backpack">The Tale of the Missing Backpack</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>As I wrote yesterday, my bag is missing. British Airlines didn&#8217;t deliver it along with myself to London, England, which has left me a little understocked in the underwear department (among other things). </p>
<p>Now how this happened, I&#8217;m not sure. As you might recall, I had made a point of checking with British Airlines when I checked in at San Francisco to make sure that my bag was properly tranferred from Alaska Airlines. They assured me it had, and would be on the flight. </p>
<p>Obviously, it didn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>I called British Airlines this morning (and put into a wonderful-sounding queue &#8212; the British have a <em>far</em> more pleasant customer service practice than we have in North America, I must say!), and learned that they had found my bag. In San Francisco! It was put on a flight yesterday, and supposedly had touched down this morning, about when I had called. They didn&#8217;t know &#8220;for certain&#8221; that the bag was, in fact, on the plane. Only that it &#8220;should&#8221; be on the plane. Specifics wouldn&#8217;t be known for a couple of hours yet. </p>
<p>So the tale continues, at least until it magically appears in our hotel room. </p>
<p>Which I hope is soon, &#8216;cuz I <strong>really</strong> need a shave.</p>

<h2 id="post-48"><a href="/../../../../2005/04/30/london-and-bag-gone-awol/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: London, and bag gone AWOL">London, and bag gone AWOL</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The flight out to London was great. Wow. I love British Airways &#8212; amazing service for an airline. So far above anything Air Canada could ever hope to dish out. The food alone was better than most things I&#8217;ve cooked in the last little while.</p>
<p>Well, except for one minor little detail. My backpack has gone missing. The bag with all my clothes, toiletries, and various supplies for the next seven weeks. </p>
<p>&#8220;Doh&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, I was neither surprised nor upset that this happened. Not even annoyed, really. I just accepted that it was an inevitability, and moved on with the day. Mind you, taking the Paddington Express from Heathrow was a little surreal without my belongings. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re at the Hilton Metropole. It&#8217;s a pretty sweet little hotel &#8212; all 8,000 rooms of it. I thought the Chicago Hyatt was big. I think this place dwarfs it several times over. Our room is nice, not huge (though it has two queens), and hopefully comfy. Though after being up for almost 36 hours (save for a couple of cat naps on the plane), you could put me on a slab of concrete and I&#8217;d find it wonderful. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03529.JPG" width="300" alt="Wellington Arch"></a></p>
<p>Did a completely self-guided walking tour through central London, from the Marble Arch to Piccadilly Circus to Trafalgar Square to Big Ben to the London Eye to Cleopatra&#8217;s Needle before running into Amy (who was off buying yarn) on the Tube. Same car. How freaky is that?</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03530.JPG" width="300" alt="Trafalgar Square"></a></p>
<p>One note on Big Ben&#8230; A (strange) dream come true &#8212; one I never knew I even had. I never would have imagined that simply hearning the clock strike the hour (six, as it turned out) would be so significant. </p>
<p>My grandmother had a wonderful grandfather clock (my aunt has it now), which plays the Westminster chime. I still can hear the sound of that clock. Today, at 18:00, I heard Big Ben play off the tune, and then strike six times. I&#8217;ve seen it before in movies and TV shows, but there&#8217;s nothing like hearing the actual strike of the big bell. You can actually feel it. </p>
<p>So far, I like this city. A lot. though it is a babylon, in the truest sense of the origins of the word. There are hundreds of languages, dialects, and accents here. But unlike the biblical Babylon, it seems to work here. It&#8217;s a strange, but beautiful mix. </p>
<p>Now if I could just figure out how to get this computer to recognize my camera&#8230; </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So, we&#8217;re in London!</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s finally sinking in. </p>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s 9pm local time and we just paid 1£ each for an hour of time on the internet. Yay. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s back up, shall we?</p>
<p>So, yesterday (Friday), Sandra and I drove to SFO to meet Geoff slightly late&#8230;ahem&#8230; after he landed at 12:30. We had already returned the rental car, so the three of us bummed around the international terminal, got some potstickers, did some window shopping, etc. Shortly after 4, Sandra had to leave to check in for her flight and we were on our way. Officially. At least, that&#8217;s how it felt. </p>
<p>Aside from the problem with Geoff&#8217;s backpack (I&#8217;ll let him explain that part), things have gone very smoothly! We even scored nice exit row seats on the plane, having plenty of legroom. I think I managed about 3 hours of sleep over the 9.5 hour flight. So, about 2 hours more than usual. At this point, I&#8217;ve been awake since 6am PST on April 29, Friday. Roughly equivalent to 31 hours without real sleep in an Actual Bed. Oy. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably why I didn&#8217;t manage to do much this afternoon. Kerrie, a knitting friend, and I were supposed to meet up at Liberty for some light yarn shopping/browsing, but something must have happened because I never found her. Still, I had a great time window shopping. And I even <i>bought yarn</i> &#8211;  6 balls of Kid Silk Haze and 4 balls of Calmer to knit on the road. </p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have done this, had I known a certain something that Sandra left on my hotel voice mail an hour ago&#8230;</p>
<p>One of my <a href="http://www.interweave.com/knits/">Interweave Knits</a> submissions was accepted! I&#8217;m still waiting to hear which one and what I have to do, but it looks like I&#8217;m going to be working on that on the road. I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to get the exact yarn called for. It&#8217;ll be interesting to say the least. </p>
<p>OK, no panicking. I just managed to work with some test knitters to do the production on my two book projects, so it&#8217;s kind of ironic. </p>
<p>So, after we&#8217;re done here, we&#8217;re off to find a more traditional pub than the one suggested by the Hilton. I want some Fish N Chips! Please!</p>

<p>Turns out that I&#8217;d forgotten to insert the comments field in the posts. </p>
<p>Doh!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s there now, but due to this weird computer I&#8217;m using (I can&#8217;t view the HTML!!), I can&#8217;t fix the layout bugs yet. When I get to a better computer, I&#8217;ll clear that up. </p>
<p>Sorry &#8217;bout that, folks! </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>You know those little stickers they give you when you check bags? The ones you&#8217;re supposed to have for when the airline loses your luggage so you can find it? Never used to take much stock in those&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;until today. I left mine on my flight from Seattle. Never used &#8217;em before, so figured why bother?</p>
<p>Turns out, as I was checking into my British Airways flight, I <em>do</em> need them, as they need to find my bag in the system. Alaska and British Airways might code share, but their luggage systems aren&#8217;t that interchangable. </p>

<p>The lovely Penelope helped me, and the bag issue has been sorted out. (I hope.)</p>
<p>I will never misplace those tags again!</p>

<p>Trapped at San Francisco airport. Food&#8217;s good, though typically pricey (it <em>is</em> an airport).</p>
<p>At least the computer at the CNBC store is free. </p>
<p>Amy should be here soon, though it&#8217;s still over six hours until we leave. </p>
