<p>On May 19, we boarded train 264 from Ulan Ude in Russia to Ulaan Baatar. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0197.JPG' alt='Train 264' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>We had read that the border crossing would be an intolerable 10 hour process, typically performed in the middle of the night. To my surprise and delight (if one can be delighted at sitting on a rail car for 10 hours without moving), we cleared Naushki in only 6 hours and made it to Sukhbaatar with a decent amount of daylight. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0200.JPG' alt='The station house at Sukhbaatar' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>As Geoff already posted, sitting in the car could be painful at times&#8230; for him. I was perfectly cool, comfortable, and able to knit. So I did. I knit about half of a shawl. And it kept me pretty darn happy. In retrospect, I&#8217;m grateful for the mild weather and the train windows that actually <i>opened</i>! You think I&#8217;m joking, but we&#8217;ve had some fairly uncomfortable train journeys that could have been vastly improved with a bit of a breeze. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Well, we&#8217;ve reached the end of our time here in Russia. Tomorrow morning, early, we&#8217;re off to Mongolia. And a 10+ hour border-crossing, so we&#8217;re told. It&#8217;s simultaneously a horror story and a quest of patience, so it seems. </p>
<p>After we arrived last night, literally 10 minutes into being in our new hotel room, the phone rang. It was &#8220;Helga from St. Petersburg&#8221;. Being more than just a little out of it, I assumed Helga was our tour operator, and was arranging our tour for tomorrow. She said she would be in the hotel, and we could meet her in the &#8220;cafeteria&#8221; (more like a bar with food). This was great since she had our train tickets to Ulaan Baatar, and would give us the details for our tour to the Datsun &#8212; the Buddhist template near Ulan Ude. </p>
<p>We walked into the cafe (as it&#8217;s referred to) about 20 minutes later only to find, much to our deep surprise, Helga &#8212; the woman we&#8217;d met in St. Petersburg whom we&#8217;d tried very desperately to avoid. (Helga had originally asked for all the details of our trip so she could tag along with us, not wanting to do the trip alone. We weren&#8217;t particularly happy about that, since we&#8217;d spent so much time and effort planning to this as a duo &#8212; not a trio.) This was not the surprise I&#8217;d wanted. </p>
<p>Since Helga had some of the information we needed, we opted to talk with her until she left for her homestay, some distance from the Hotel Geser. Why did she have all this information? She ran into the tour guide we were using, and had signed up for the same tour to the Datsun. </p>
<p>The trip out today was quite nice, actually. Ulan Ude is in a steppe valley, which is wide, expansive, and fairly flat. It&#8217;s dominated more by <em>dacha</em> (small cottages). Otherwise, short grasses and free-roaming animals (cows, goats, horses) which are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the local buryat inhabitants. The region we&#8217;re in is named for them: Buryatia. They&#8217;re an offshoot of Mongolian society, who&#8217;ve decided not to be nomadic and settle permanently. </p>
<p>The result of the Mongolian influence in this area brings the Buddhism, which is what we&#8217;d planned to see today. <a href="http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/russia.htm">Ivolginsky Datsun</a> dates back only to 1947, when Stalin (of all people!) allowed limited religious practices for recognized minorities, such as the buryats. </p>
<p>On the 30 km drive out to the Datsun, our guide Ilyena (I believe that was her name) attempted to explain the history of Ulan Ude, the general environment around us, and the basics of Buddhism. All of which Helga continually interrupted with questions &#8212; some decent, but mostly inane. And annoying, since Ilyena was continually put off her speech, and found it difficult to continue. Thankfully, Amy and I have a good understanding of Buddhism, and had read much about the area through our guidebooks. </p>
<p>The Datsun itself is quite interesting. Because it was built only a little over a half century ago (and even then, the main temple burned down just before it initially was to open), most of the buildings are reminiscent of Soviet construction: big and stolid. Yet there is still a blending with Buddhist stylings, with all the statuary and stupas one would expect to find. Though here, they&#8217;re made of concrete and not wood or stone. The insides of the temples, though still Buddhist, borrow concepts from Russian churches (such as windows and high ceilings), a result of Russian influences on the Buryats when they tried to settle in the area.</p>
<p>There were few other tourists there than ourselves, so we had a fairly easy time getting around. Although Ivolginsky Datsun is the centre for Russian buddhism, it&#8217;s not heavily visited at all times. There are strong ties here with both Mongolia (which is a very powerful buddhist centre, so I&#8217;ve learned) and, of course, Tibet. </p>
<p>On the way back, we got to ask Ilyena a few questions. Well, to be most specific, Amy and I got to ask a few questions &#8212; Helga wouldn&#8217;t let up. To the point where she was outright challenging Ilyena about the differences between hardships under Soviet rule versus Helga&#8217;s post-war upbringing in the late 1940s &#8211; early 1950s. It was enough for me to bite my tongue &#8212; hard &#8212; and not suggest that Helga put a cork in it. It&#8217;s enough to ask questions, but an entirely different thing to disrespect your hosts by suggesting their troubles in life are trivial. </p>
<p>We finally ditched Helga, and picked up our train tickets for tomorrow, and went off to explore the rest of Ulan Ude. Admittedly, there isn&#8217;t much else to see in this city, save for two museums that aren&#8217;t easy to get to. Across the road from our end-point was a nice opera theatre that looked almost like it had been plucked out from Spain. Next door to that was the Mongolian Embassy. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03587.JPG" width="300" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude and the opera house"></a></p>
<p>Down the road (to the south) was the GUM department store and market &#8212; of which there wasn&#8217;t much. However, there were <strong>delectable</strong> blinni &#8212; which are crepe-like panckages filled with (in our case) cheese and ham. The pedestrian mall took us down to a recently-renovated church, before we walked back towards our hotel, and the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03589.JPG" width="300" alt="Big dead Lenin and head and I"></a></p>
<p>Why is the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head in Ulan Ude? Got me. I can see it from this computer. It&#8217;s <em>HUGE</em>. It&#8217;s at least two storeys tall. The body, if there were one, would tower over Ulan Ude. Vlad-zilla! </p>
<p>We&#8217;re preparing for tomorrow&#8217;s trip. Not just with supplies (food and water), but also mentally. Mongolians like to smuggle things across the border, and we need to be prepared for the possibility that they might try to muscle their way into our compartment &#8212; which we bought all the seats in to prevent us getting caught with smugglers. </p>
<p>Either way, the next time you hear from us, we&#8217;ll be in another country. </p>

<h2 id="post-102"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/18/ulan-ude-buryatia/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Ulan Ude, Buryatia">Ulan Ude, Buryatia</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Well, we are here for our last non-mobile night in Russia in Ulan Ude, the capital of Russian Buryatia. We arrived last night after a too-long 7 hour daytime scenic train ride, exhausted and happy to be in a room with beds and a hot shower. </p>
<p>This morning, we met up with our guide from Baikal Naran Tour to head to Involgsk Datsan, the center of russian Buddhism near Ulan Ude. The Datsan (monastery/temple) was beautiful and very peaceful, and I unfortunately only took film and 35mm photos there, nothing on digital to post. I&#8217;ve been inside various Buddhist temples in Japan and Thailand and North America, but the Russian flavour was quite different, with high ceilings, quilts on the ceiling, and skylights. It was beautiful and well worth the time and effort in getting there. </p>
<p>After our tour ended, around 1, we walked around the downtown core of Ulan Ude. A city of almost 500,000 now, 380,000 in 2001 when our guidebook was published, Ulan Ude is large and spread out, but the downtown core is fairly compact and easy to walk. </p>
<p>We stopped for quite a bit at this spectacular opera and ballet theater. It reminded me more of something to be seen in Spain or Austria than in Siberia. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0184.JPG' alt='The main theater in Ulan Ude' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Walking up Ulitsa Lenina, we strolled along another pedestrian mall and through the central market (disappointing compared to Kazan) to this church which sparkled in the afternoon sunlight. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0186.JPG' alt='Main Church in Ulan Ude' width="300"></a></p>
<p>And of course, no tour of Ulan Ude would be complete without a visit to Russia&#8217;s largest &#8220;Head of Lenin&#8221;, dominating the central square. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0192_01.JPG' alt='Largest Lenin Head' width="300"></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been particularly blessed with weather. While yesterday, on the train, was dreary and rainy, today was beautifully mild and sunny. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/IMGA0190.JPG" alt="Hot enough for sunglasses" width="300"></a> </p>
<p>After this quick post, we head back to the hotel to get our food and packing sorted for tomorrow&#8217;s VERY EARLY train. Leaving just before 1am Moscow time, 6am local time, it&#8217;s earlier than we&#8217;re used to on this trip. But at least we should have hot showers in the morning! </p>
<p>This train, I am particularly nervous about. We&#8217;ve booked the entire 4 bunk compartment, but we&#8217;ve also heard some stories from other travellers about mongolian traders trying to take over every available space in every compartment, whether or not they actually are staying in that compartment. We&#8217;re hoping to just keep the door locked and secured and hope it&#8217;s more calm than that. OK, to be honest, we&#8217;ve only heard of one traveller with this problem, a lady from Wales we met in the hotel today. Our Aussie acquaintences in Irkutsk never mentioned this problem. So, here&#8217;s hoping! Either way, I will be very glad when our guide meets us in Ulan Baatar. </p>

<h2 id="post-101"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/17/the-last-russian-stop/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: The last Russian stop">The last Russian stop</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>We&#8217;re in Ulan Ude now, having arrived a bit later last night than scheduled. (Mind you, it took a half hour to walk from the train to the hotel.) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice little city of about a half million &#8230; and no birch trees!!! <em>Finally.</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be here until <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning, when we leave for Mongolia. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to such an early morning, I&#8217;ll tell you. </p>
<p>Slept mostly on the train, which was about the only way to pass through the pain. It&#8217;s a six and a half hour trip from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude, a distance of no more than 300 km (straight-line, that is). The train needs to take a few bendy twists going through the mountains, pass through a couple of tunnels, and then plods along at an agonizingly slow 50 km/h (estimated). I think we topped out at a few places around 80. </p>
<p>The eastern shore of Lake Baikal was frozen &#8212; ice as far as you could see. The exact opposite of what we&#8217;d seen in Listvyanka two days ago. It looks like it&#8217;s thawing quickly, though, so it shouldn&#8217;t be long before the clear waters show through. </p>
<p>Two of our housemates in Irkutsk (a pair of Aussies) told us two things: 1) that we&#8217;d love Mongolia (something we&#8217;d both strongly suspected), and 2) China would wear us down fast. It&#8217;s chaotic, the toilets are disaster areas (that actually scares us), the &#8220;queues&#8221; aren&#8217;t, and pretty much everything we&#8217;d wanted to see is buried under scaffolding. It seems everyone is upgrading this year. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re just waiting for our tour to start today &#8212; we actually got a guide for here &#8212; and will be back later with more. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="post-100"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/16/listvyanka-and-lake-baikal/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Listvyanka and Lake Baikal">Listvyanka and Lake Baikal</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The cold seems to be slowly moving away. It hit me a little harder than it did Amy, so while she dealt mostly with the sniffles, I&#8217;ve been dealt the ol&#8217; phlegm-attack. Mostly throat clearing, so it ain&#8217;t all nasty. </p>
<p>Until today, I had yet to cash any of my traveller&#8217;s cheques. Useful things these are not. Major problem: very few places in Russia care to honour them. You have search high and low to find places that will handle them, and not for an obscene rate of conversion. It&#8217;s silly, really. In future, I&#8217;m sticking to my usual system: bring a bank card. It&#8217;s accepted at most ATMs world-wide, though you do sometimes have to hunt for the right ones. </p>
<p>After that, we got our visas registered for Irkutsk. It&#8217;s a leftover from the Soviet era, so far as I can understand. Basically, any place you stay overnight, you should have your visa registered by your hotel or by the registration office. What ultimate purpose this serves, I have no idea. All I do know is that if your visa isn&#8217;t suitably registered, and you don&#8217;t have all the paperwork, you&#8217;re likely to be buying out the border guard as you try to exit. Most importantly, as in our case, if travelling by train. </p>
<p>Jack had double-booked himself for today, and had to take a group out of town on a three-day excursion (to where, I have no idea). He was supposed to take us to Listvyanka, a small town on the shore of Lake Baikal, about 60 kms away. Instead, he made arrangements with his friend Leonid (yes, like the meteor shower) to take us out. </p>
<p>When I&#8217;d talked with Leonid last night, I had wondered what lay in store for us. Was he just a &#8220;friend&#8221;, or was there more of a professional association to him? (As Amy has pointed out, Leonid has his own company for this very thing. Normally, he does long-term fishing excursions, but made an exception for us.) He rolled up to Jack&#8217;s homestay almost exactly at noon &#8212; when he&#8217;d promised to be there. </p>
<p>Leonid has a nice car &#8212; nice by Russian standards, definitely; nice by North American standards, pretty much. It&#8217;s a Toyota Mark II &#8212; Japanese model, so far as I can tell. (It was right-side drive.) The sound system was aftermarket, though, and was regularly playing Ivan Kupala &#8212; an artist reminiscent of Enigma and Delerium, except that he used the songs of old Russian women (singing old Russian songs) as the main part. Amy and I will be hunting for this CD, without question. </p>
<p>After a short stop at the local DHL (despite packing light, this is the second batch of things Amy has sent home &#8212; keep in mind, however, that she did buy 10 balls of yarn in Kazan), we headed out on the sole road from Irkutsk to Listvyanka. It&#8217;s a rolling road, curving sometimes within sight of the Angara River, lined with birch, larch, and various coniferous trees. </p>
<p>Our first stop, however, was not Listvyanka &#8212; it was the Museum of Wooden Architecture. Sounds kinda silly, I know, but museum is just like Heritage Park (in Calgary) or any other pioneer-esque recreation village showing the way life used to be here. But it&#8217;s not all about the stereotypical exiled-Russian-living-in-Siberia thing. This was about the Cossaks, the first Europeans to move to this region. How they built their forts to survive against the weather. And about the Buryats, decendents of the Mongols who settled here in permanent wooden gers. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03579.JPG" width="300" alt="The Museum of Wooden Arcitecture near Irkutsk"></a></p>
<p>The entire village is made of various buildings, most of which were brought to the museum before their original village locations (often many kilometres away) were flooded out with the damming of the Angara back in the 50s. The reconstruction is mostly complete, and gives a pretty clear idea of what life was like in this region of the world, 300 years ago. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03580.JPG" width="300" alt="Inside one of the buildings at the museum"></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the key difference between what we see at home and what&#8217;s here. The stuff we have in Calgary is rarely older than 150 years. This is twice that. The buildings are solid wood &#8212; mostly log houses (in various forms). Some are intricate, having several rooms, and separate buildings (for storage of grains and animals). There was a certain flow to everything. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03584.JPG" width="300" alt="Me, at the Museum of Wooden Architecture near Irkutsk (I gotta try to keep up with Amy!)"></a></p>
<p>Each building also had what Leonid called a &#8220;red corner&#8221;, which is supposed to be on the right side of the main room when seen from the door. This is what most would call a shrine. It depicts the Russian orthodox religion, and is a personal place of worship outside of the church. Leonid didn&#8217;t know why it was a &#8220;red&#8221; corner, though. I think it&#8217;s because the Russian word &#8220;??????&#8221; originally meant &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in English. Only today does it mean &#8220;red&#8221; &#8212; and the original meaning is lost in translation. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03581.JPG" width="300" alt="An example of a Red Corner; the museum screwed up and put it on the left side by accident"></a></p>
<p>From the museum, we continued down to Listvyanka. When we reached the mouth of the river, Leonid pulled his car over and told us a story about a rock that you can see in the mouth. The legend says that Lake Baikal has 340 sons, but only one daughter &#8212; the Angara River, the sole outlet of the world largest freshwater lake (by volume). The Angara flows into the Yenisey, and it&#8217;s said that the Angara wished to leave Lake Baikal to be with her lover. Lake Baikal refused and threw a stone to keep her from getting away. Today, it&#8217;s called the &#8220;shaman&#8217;s stone&#8221;. Angara got away, however, and Lake Baikal grew bitter and cold. It&#8217;s known for freezing over entirely, and for very nasty storms. </p>
<p>Listvyanka is a town that was forgotten by the Soviet regieme &#8212; or the town chose simply to ignore it. The entire village is wooden; the original part, anyway. Because of its proximity to Lake Baikal, many of the nouveau riche have bought up land and erected the most gaudy monstrosities you&#8217;ve ever seen. They look like someone tried to replicate a fairy tale castle, but used cheap bricks and garish pink paint. </p>
<p>Ew. </p>
<p>Lonely Planet (among various sources) recommended Listvyanka as a place to visit because it is reflective of an old Russian fishing village. It&#8217;s harder to see now, with the newer buildings (and a hotel under construction) that effectively ruin the charm. It was neat to see, but I imagine that within two years, Listvyanka won&#8217;t have the same appeal it did even a year ago. </p>
<p>As we drove down the waterfront, we spotted ice washing up on shore. Leonid had told us that as little as three days ago (!), there was still ice on Lake Baikal in this area. Indeed, if you go further north, you can still drive across the lake &#8212; the ice will remain until well into June. The ice, combined with Lake Baikal&#8217;s ferocity, turned a wooden breakwater into near toothpicks a week ago. </p>
<p>The pier was full of vendors. Some selling cheap (but expensive) souveniers, and lots of fish. The lake is full of fish and tends to be quite bountiful. And clear, so the fish likely taste quite good. We weren&#8217;t too keen on anything fishy today, though. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03586.JPG" width="300" alt="Me (with suitably dopey grin) at Lake Baikal"></a></p>
<p>We returned to Irkutsk, stopping only a couple of times for a last look at the lake, and for a nice photo op we noticed on the way back. It was a six-hour excursion, and both Amy and I would highly recommend calling Leonid if you&#8217;re in the area and need an excellent guide. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, we head off for Ulan Ude. We&#8217;re nearly out of Russia and into Mongolia. Time is passing too slowly for me, though, as I want to get moving back towards home. As much as I love travelling, I really miss Alex. </p>

<h2 id="post-99"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/16/there-can-never-be-too-much-amy/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: There can never be too much Amy">There can never be too much Amy</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I think Geoff has thrown down the gauntlet. Thus today will be the almost &#8220;All Amy All The Time&#8221; post. (It conveniently worked out this way because I took most of the great shots on my film camera, for once, and only used the digital for the silly ones.)</p>
<p>Today was our one and only day in Russia with a guide. We had originally hired Jack, whose house we are staying at, to give us a 5 hour tour of Listvyanka, a nearby village on the shores of Lake Baikal. I&#8217;m usually not one for tour groups, but since this was just us, and since paying $45 each to Jack was pretty much the only way to get all the way to the Lake and back in one day, I thought it was well worth the expense. </p>
<p>Little did I expect that I would have gladly paid twice that for the experience we had today. </p>
<p>Jack was heading out on an overnight tour with a larger group, so he put us in contact with his friend Leonid. Now, at the time, we basically heard &#8220;My friend Leonid&#8221; and never imagined this guy would actually be a professional in the travel industry. We expected mafia, some sort of good-for-nothing, one of the beer-for-breakfast crew that&#8217;s so popular around here, but we never expected what we got. </p>
<p>It turns out that Leonid manages and runs a rather professional independant tour group, <a href="http://www.baikalex.com/" target="_blank">Baikal Explorer</a>, here in Irkutsk. And let me tell you, next time I&#8217;m in the area (and I will be!), I am calling Leonid. </p>
<p>To start with, he was an extremely fantastic driver. Had the reaction time of a cheetah. Negotiated road bumps so his car would be babied the entire time. Just amazing. And on top of that, at our first stop, the Wooden Architecture &#8220;Museum&#8221;, he proved to be a knowledgeable and fascinating narrator. When he knew some of the rooms or buildings he would tell us about them. Otherwise, he would translate what the very helpful museum curators had to say about the building. </p>
<p>Having never been in a &#8220;guide&#8221; situation other than in large groups, perhaps I can&#8217;t really convey how amazing it was to be able to ask questions. Just to ask questions. For example, in one of the first buildings, a display featuring a loom and what looked like knitted socks had been set up. The curator didn&#8217;t mention the socks, but I wanted to learn more about them so I just asked Leonid. Just like that. And I found out what I wanted to know. </p>
<p>OK, enough raving for now. </p>
<p>The Museum wasn&#8217;t so much a museum as it was an outdoor reconstructed village with old (17th century) and  (18th century) Russian homes and buildings, as well as a Buryat camp. The Buryats are the &#8220;native&#8221; people of the area before the european Russians settled here. A non-nomadic Mongolian group, they settled in this area long ago in dwellings of similar construction to the mobile Ger camps we&#8217;ll be staying in this weekend. (yeep!!!!) </p>
<p>One of the highlights, aside from the huge wealth of information, is just being able to appreciate some of the craftsmanship details. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0171.JPG' alt='At the Taltsy Museum' width="300"></a></p>
<p>After the museum, we headed back into the car to Listvyanka and Lake Baikal. I knew in advance that Lake Baikal would be one of the largest &#8220;names&#8221; on our list of destinations. But, I wasn&#8217;t prepared for exactly how striking this largest freshwater lake would be. </p>
<p>Baikal is also the deepest lake in the world. At it&#8217;s greatest depth, it&#8217;s more than 1km deep, plus an additional 900m of loose sediment. It&#8217;s also the center of two of the earth&#8217;s techtonic plates, and really important geographically speaking. </p>
<p>We arrived just as another rain shower was clearing. The mountains in the distance were hazy and quiet and calm, and the water was crystal clear. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0175.JPG' alt='Lake Baikal' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>One interesting (the only) site in Listvyanka is this breakwater that had been&#8230; broken&#8230; just a week before by a huge wave of ice, as Leonid described it. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0177.JPG' alt='The broken breakwater' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>All in all, today was a definite highlight of our time in Russia. I&#8217;m much less skeptical about the whole &#8220;guided tour&#8221; thing. Certainly, had we tried to do this on our own, it would have taken two days and I doubt we would have gotten this much out of it. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0183.JPG' alt='Blue beautiful sky' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Happy.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I&#8217;m finally clean! That was the best shower of my life!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0161.JPG' alt='Finally clean!' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>After getting our bags, scouring&#8230; I mean showering&#8230; and changing, we headed out in search of dinner in Irkutsk. Mind you, we had already had somewhat satisfying sushi for lunch today, but we couldn&#8217;t resist this little gem near our hostel&#8230;</p>
<p><i>Bacabu</i> doesn&#8217;t have a website, but it was designed like something out of SOMA. And the food was great! Geoff and I agreed that it easily slid into our respective &#8220;top 10 sushi restaurant&#8221; lists, even when you include Japan. (Which is hard for me to remember, so I guesstimated.)</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0167.JPG' alt='Mmm... dinner!' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Look at this fantastic presentation!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0168.JPG' alt='Maguro Maki like I\&#039;ve never had it before' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s BBQ eel (unagi), wrapped in rice, wrapped in seaweed, wrapped in raw tuna (maguro) and it&#8217;s amazing. The cool crisp flavor of the tuna really contrasted nicely with the sweet and slightly warm unagi. Perfect. </p>
<p>For those of you keeping track, this is the third time we&#8217;ve had sushi since arriving in Russia. Odd? Hardly. Considering this trip was initially discussed over sushi in Calgary, it seems apropos. Plus, even without an english menu, it&#8217;s easy to order sushi in any language. </p>
<p>Maguro is Maguro is Maguro. </p>

<h2 id="post-90"><a href="/../../../../2005/05/15/alive-in-irkutsk/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Alive in Irkutsk!">Alive in Irkutsk!</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>You know that feeling you get, when you&#8217;re finding yourself walking down a street in a dream, and you&#8217;re not sure if you know where you are, but you keep going anyway? That&#8217;s what Amy and I have been feeling like the last few hours. We&#8217;ve been speculating to guess why (I attributed part of it to being sick and drugged up on Contac-C; Amy&#8217;s blaming the fish she had for dinner last night), but we&#8217;re not entirely sure. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03574.JPG" width="300" alt="The Irkutsk railway station"></a></p>
<p>We figure part of it is due to not knowing exactly where we were staying. Amy&#8217;d emailed Jack &#8212; our homestay host &#8212; only to receive not that he was out of town. Turns out he&#8217;s not, and it was an old notice. Before we&#8217;d found that out, though, we&#8217;d endulged ourselves in a little comfort food. </p>
<p>Sushi. (We love the stuff.)</p>
<p>It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been in a Japanese restaurant that didn&#8217;t have a single Japanese person working there. Bit of a switch, I have to say. The food was pretty good, even if I could only barely taste the pickled ginger (I hate being sick <em>(cough)</em>). </p>
<p>We wandered around a bit, still in a daze, before we finally found a pay phone that took coins. Weird thing &#8212; almost none of the phones in Russia take coins. Almost all of them take phone cards. Which we don&#8217;t have, and aren&#8217;t even sure how to buy. The connection was lousy (it was an old phone &#8212; you dialed the number, inserted the coin, and then pressed a little button to make the coin drop when you finally connected with the other person), but we got enough information to find the building. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03575.JPG" width="300" alt="Yes, it's a camel. No, I don't know what it's doing in Irkutsk."></a></p>
<p>Just not the door. We had to call back from the internet cafe we were at this morning. That was much better, and we met Elena in the alley. Figured that it was the one door we didn&#8217;t try because we didn&#8217;t see the buzzer. Now we know better&#8230; </p>
<p>I feel a whole lot better having finally found the place we&#8217;re staying for two nights. It&#8217;s going to be relaxful because there is no rush, no need to run to the next place. And no flotilla of security to prevent us from going wherever we want. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been on the go, more or less, since we left Moscow. (Which, incidentally, was the last time I showered properly. I&#8217;m amazed Amy hasn&#8217;t passed out from the smell. I&#8217;m sure my pants are fully capable of sentience at this point.)  You have no idea how good it feels just to stop moving, even if just for a day.</p>
<p>The place is nice, though you wouldn&#8217;t know from the stairwell. It&#8217;s even sketchier than Nord Hostel in St. Petersburg. The inside of the apartment is quite nice, and there&#8217;s a little cat (Fyodor, apparently after the writer) to entertain us.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;re off to Listyvanka, which is a small village on Lake Baikal, which is &#8220;traditional siberian&#8221;, which means all wooden buildings. There&#8217;s a number of those here in downtown Irkutsk (pop. ~600k), but I imagine kept in better conditions. </p>
<p>Until then&#8230; to rest, to sleep &#8212; perchance to dream&#8230;</p>
