				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, being a traveler in my old neck of the woods. I am in San Jose for work, which is the best possible way to spend a week back in the &#8220;real world&#8221;. I am writing this on the breezy patio at Gordon Biersch in San Jose, enjoying a czech-style pilsner. </p>
<p>Is it wrong that the artfully crumbling brick buildings remind me of that courtyard in Kazan? These are gentrified, with miniature lights and flower pots on the windowsills, with brick and tile neatly laid beneath iron patio chairs. In Kazan, the windows were shattered, the courtyard laid only with dust and dirt, and the chairs a sunburnt plastic.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='//media/alleycafe.jpg' alt='The courtyard cafe in Kazan' width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Still, if I am able to hold no other memory dear, it will be that one; walking hesitantly through the dark alley only to emerge into a crumbling concrete eden; dun-drenched, idyllic, unforgettable. </p>
<p>I spend so much time lately pondering what it means to travel. But more than just the act of emotionally and physically experience the world, there&#8217;s the other deeper and darker act of dedicating your body and soul, emotionally and physically, to the road. </p>
<p><!--If I have no permanent companion in life, I know I will have the world to adore. --></p>
<p>From Kazan to Kyoto to Krasnoyarsk to Kansas, it&#8217;s all intoxicating, it all makes my heart quicken, my breath catch, my blood pulse. Even the lowlights are experiences to savour, as cheesy as that sounds. I don&#8217;t for a moment regret spending those few boring hours in Krasnoyarsk, because it gave me that intense thrill of finally escaping for a better destination. </p>
<p>I get it now. I can&#8217;t live without this any more than I can give up air. </p>
<p>I may never own a million dollar house on the Elbow river. I may never drive a BMW, even a 3-series. But whatever else life has to teach me, I know I will always hunger for that terrifying and thrilling moment of stepping out the door of the train, the bus, the plane, and into someplace new, someplace unexplored.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience. </p>
<p>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03526.JPG" width="300" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" /></a></p>
<p>Our British Airways 747 to London:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03527.JPG" width="300" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" /></a></p>
<p>The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03533.JPG" width="300" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" /></a></p>
<p>Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>And periodically, you do see other trains:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The forests often get thicker, too:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China: </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03674.JPG" alt="Get on the train!" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03677.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03678.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03679.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03680.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03692.JPG" alt="No Hawking" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Ferry traffic!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03695.JPG" alt="Boat traffic in Hong Kong Harbour" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03703.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03704.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03705.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03707.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03708.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03709.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03711.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03712.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03713.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03718.JPG" alt="Jackie Chan plugs Hollywood Fitness" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Inside our favourite dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03722.JPG" alt="Mmmm... dim sum" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03741.JPG" alt="It was still tasty" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting light in the east, and birds are chirping away. I just chatted on the phone with my dear friend <a href="http://www.yarnageddon.com">Mandy</a> who typically is awake until 6:30 or so every night, which is 7:30 my time. Handy! And nice and distracting. There&#8217;s not much else to do at 4:00am. I&#8217;ve already written, already caught up with some work stuff. My eyes hurt too much to read for any length of time. I could start editing the video&#8230; oh wait, that&#8217;s a brilliant idea!</p>
<p>But maybe I&#8217;ll save it for the next night. If this is anything like my trip to Thailand&#8230; it might take me awhile to readjust. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um&#8230; someone stop the world, please? I wanna get off. </p>
<p>Wow. </p>
<p>The world is a lot bigger than one would expect. Sure, Disney says it&#8217;s a &#8220;Small, Small World&#8221;, but trying going around it sometime. And I don&#8217;t mean by plane &#8212; go around it by surface. It takes a lot longer, and you&#8217;ll see a lot more. </p>
<p>Biggest surprise in the whole trip? Reverse culture shock. Didn&#8217;t see that coming, I tell ya. After seven weeks of blocking out all other languages to concentrate on the rare blips of English (signage and speech), arriving in San Francisco about overloaded me. Ouch. </p>
<p>The Bow River is flooding. The main highway was renamed. And those are the only two things we knew about on the road. Adjusting back is going to take some time&#8230; </p>

<p>Weird. Perfect kelly-green lawns, near-identical houses, SUVs. </p>
<p>Had some of this feeling in San Francisco yesterday. So much English everywhere it sort of made my head hurt, being able to understand every single conversation going on around me. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This constant forward movement<br />
has made a blur of everything.<br />
Even you<br />
are not as clear<br />
as even yesterday.</p>
<p>Is it bad that I miss you<br />
not with the decapitating pain<br />
of a crushed bone &#8211;<br />
not with the haunting memory<br />
of a missing limb &#8211;<br />
but with the sweet senese<br />
of a secret<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to reveal?</p>
<p>After all, loving you<br />
does not hurt.</p>
<p>I do not bruise<br />
remembering your touch,<br />
I do not burn<br />
imagining your breath,<br />
I do not cry acid tears<br />
when your eyes<br />
dance circles around me<br />
even in this photograph,<br />
even in my mind.</p>
<p>Is it bad that I do not fear this slight separation?<br />
This pause?<br />
This insignificant<br />
delay<br />
between our life and</p>
<p><i>our</i> </p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>After all, I am never alone.<br />
You are here, even here,<br />
even now.</p>
<p>You are the business man<br />
sleeping soundly in the next seat.<br />
You are the impatient woman in 15B<br />
who cannot wait to land. </p>
<p>You are Joni Mitchell&#8217;s sweet<br />
sweet voice and<br />
you are a hundred country songs that leave me<br />
choked up<br />
every time. </p>
<p>You are the baby girl several rows ahead.<br />
You are every laugh from my<br />
tiny tiny screen and every<br />
witty line of dialogue in Ocean&#8217;s 12.</p>
<p>How can I miss you any other way?</p>
<p>You are my pilot<br />
after all.</p>
<p>You bring me home.</p>
