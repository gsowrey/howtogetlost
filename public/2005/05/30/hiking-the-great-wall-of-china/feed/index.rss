		<description><![CDATA[I would say don&#039;t feel like a &quot;poseur.&quot;  Look at all the rest of us who are like, &quot;Wow, this trip sounds fabulous,&quot; but wouldn&#039;t ever take the time off from work/life/partners to do it.  That&#039;s quite an accomplishment.  And traveling, no matter how it&#039;s done, is really a feat,especially this trip you&#039;re taking.  When I first read about it on Amy&#039;s blog, I thought, &quot;Nah, they&#039;re never gonna actually do it.  It&#039;s just a pipe dream.&quot;  But look at you two, you&#039;re really doing it.  Going to China/Mongolia/Russia are not places that I would normally even consider, but China is sounding great and very interesting to read about it.  As long as you&#039;re happy with your trip, that&#039;s the important thing.  There will always be people that you think are doing something better/cooler/different than you, but only you have to be happy with your decisions.  Enjoy!]]></description>
