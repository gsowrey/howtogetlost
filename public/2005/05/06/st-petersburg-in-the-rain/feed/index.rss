		<description><![CDATA[Wow that cathedral is amazing, it reminds me of a church i visited in sweden. One thing i was pondering the past few days of reading your posts, you&#039;ve mentioned nothing of language issues (or i missed it). It seems like you&#039;re getting by ok though?

Hope you get more sunshine soon!
