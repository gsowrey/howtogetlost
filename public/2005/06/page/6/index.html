<h2 id="post-131"><a href="/../../02/in-the-house-of-mao/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: In the House of Mao">In the House of Mao</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Chalk up another notch on the Dead Commuist Leader Tour. </p>
<p>Today, Amy and I decided to keep things light, since our train leaves tonight for Shanghai. On the list of things to hit: Mao Ze Dong&#8217;s Mausoleum, and the Lama Temple. But first, the House of Mao&#8230;</p>
<p>When Mao finally kicked the bucket in the 70s, he was well into this 90s, something the Chinese are quite proud of (and probably cigarette companies, too, since he chain-smoked something fierce). When Mao died, they couldn&#8217;t simply bury him. He was (and still is) a driving force in Chinese life. So they built him a mausoleum. A big one. Nay, a gigantic one. One that rivals the size of small office buildings. All to house the not-really-decaying body of Mao. </p>
<p>To keep this in perspective, I&#8217;ve also been to Lenin&#8217;s Mausoleum. (That was 16 years ago.) It&#8217;s very small, by comparison &#8212; maybe 10&#215;10 metres. This place is easy 100&#215;100 metres. And four or so stories tall. There&#8217;s considerably more security around it than at Lenin&#8217;s tomb, even during the Soviet era. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03645.JPG" width="300" alt="Mao's Mausoleum"></a> </p>
<p>Because of all the shady people about, and because we couldn&#8217;t find lockers to stow our stuff so we could go inside, Amy and I took turns. Amy went first, because I&#8217;d already seen a dead commie. When I asked her how she felt when she got back, her immediate response was &#8220;respectful&#8221;. </p>
<p>My turn. I had to stand in a line for about 10 minutes before they took a batch of about 40 people around the corner and inside the perimeter to see Mao. You pass by a small booth that sells fresh flowers to lay within the mausoleum building (though it&#8217;s interesting to note that the flowers are &#8220;laid&#8221; in a different room than Mao himself). Then up a set of stairs and into doors that wouldn&#8217;t be any different than an office building&#8217;s. Complete with revolving doors that can&#8217;t really be used all that often. </p>
<p>The atrium features a larger-than-life white marble sculpture of Mao, seated facing north. This is where some kind of trough exists for placing the newly-purchased flowers. (A cynic might suggest that the flowers are collected and taken to the booth for resale.) The line winds around the atrium to the left (east), down the side of the building, then back to the centre to enter the mausoleum chamber. In the centre of the chamber is the Big Guy himself. There&#8217;s a glass wall that separates you from him, and several soliders standing on guard. Mao is contained within a glass sarcophogus, his body draped in what looks to be a Soviet flag. (The hammer and sickle are a symbol of the people, though it would seem more appropriate to use the Chinese flag &#8230; that&#8217;s just me.) </p>
<p>After being hustled through the Room of Mao, you enter into &#8230; a souvenir shop. No, I&#8217;m not kidding. I wish I were making that up. In fact, from the inside of the building all the way until you reach the perimeter again, it&#8217;s all Mao kitch. It&#8217;s tackiness on a level I can&#8217;t even begin to understand. The Soviets were never like this &#8212; Lenin&#8217;s tomb was a simple thing &#8212; even now, the Russians treat it with respect. (Although it&#8217;s said Lenin will be buried in St. Petersburg before too long.) </p>
<p>Seeing Mao was interesting, but not so much as all the grandeur surrounding it. People still worship the man (inasmuch as the officially Communist state allows worship), gathering in lines readily, half of whom buy flowers, for a man most never met and even more whom weren&#8217;t even alive during his tenure as Chairman. The legacy lives on&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>OK, I know this is out of order. But I have an hour to kill and some photos to post so I can clear off my SIM card and take more!</p>
<p>We did end up going to the Forbidden City for a day. The day started off lovely but soon degraded into a thunderstorm. On the way in, we found this cute little park. Oddly quiet and peaceful considering it&#8217;s location in the center of Tourist Beijing. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0235.JPG' alt='Nice Little Park by the Forbidden City' width="300"> </a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0236.JPG' alt='Another bridge' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Of course, the park isn&#8217;t the reason to go there, the Forbidden City is. Long kept only as a haven for the Emperor and his favorites, the Forbidden City is now open to anyone who wants to pay for admission with a few yuan instead of one&#8217;s life. </p>
<p>Probably in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, over 50% of the buildings were under scaffolding for renovation. But, we still got to see a fair bit and appreciate the vastness of the compound. </p>
<p>Proof I need a haircut:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0238.JPG' alt='hey look! i have bad hair!' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Before we got too far, it started pouring. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0239.JPG' alt='The rain begins' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>And pouring. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0240.JPG' alt='More rain' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>By the time we reached the hotel (couldn&#8217;t find a cab), we were soaked to the bone. </p>
<p>Maybe I should have bought one of those umbrellas?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve mentioned, but dripping is not really appropriate in the Pennisula Palace Hotel. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0241.JPG' alt='My favorite store and yours' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Not when they serve dessert that looks like this, anyway. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0242.JPG' alt='Mmmm... dessert' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Or have bathrooms that look like this.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0243.JPG' alt='swanky public bathroom' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Who says you have to rough it all the time????</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Some companies, those that want to be &#8220;fun&#8221; companies, sometimes give their staff things like shirts, bags, water jugs, and various other bits of paraphernalia emblazoned with the company logo. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Critical Mass gave us sling bags, in either blue or yellow, with the Critical Mass logo on the back. Some people thought they were kinda dorky. Me? I&#8217;m loving this thing! </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03633.JPG" width="300" alt="Critical Mass on the Great Wall of China"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who specifically chose this bag style, but I&#8217;ll assume it was someone like Cyndy. This bag has been lugged most of the way around the world now, acting as my day pack. It&#8217;s been on the Great Wall. It&#8217;s been through the Hermitage. It&#8217;s seen the deserts of Mongolia. And it&#8217;s been rained on a couple of times (including a nice, semi-tropical downpour) and kept my stuff dry! </p>
<p>So far, the only problem has been the stitching falling apart on the velcro for the side flap. Nothing 30 minutes with a sewing kit can&#8217;t fix. </p>
<p>Did I mention that I love this bag?</p>

<h2 id="post-130"><a href="/../../01/bye-bye-beijing/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Bye bye Beijing">Bye bye Beijing</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I&#8217;ve been in Beijing almost as long as we were in Mongolia, and yet I feel I&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of things here. We&#8217;ve seen most of the major tourist spots and spent more than a fair amount of hours wandering in the little neighborhoods of food stalls and restaurants that are off the beaten track. We&#8217;ve eaten Beijing Duck (aka Peking Duck), dumplings, kung pao chicken, more dumplings, some barbeque pork buns, more dumplings, more noodles, and potlickers (aka, potstickers). </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been hassled with and haggled with. We&#8217;ve gotten some good deals and been overcharged heinously. </p>
<p>All in all, a most excellent time. </p>
<p>Have I mentioned I love Beijing???</p>
<p>Did I mention that yet? </p>
<p>This morning we headed out to visit Chairman Mao. Dear old Mao, entombed and embalmed and on display some 40 hours per week. They herd you through like cattle, but on the plus side, the entire visit only took about 17 minutes, including the walk around the Mausoleum to the start of the entrance queue. </p>
<p>So now we are at a much cheaper internet cafe&#8230; 10Y for 30 minutes instead of the horrendous 60Y they charge at the hotel. Of course, at the hotel, you get free bottled water. <i>Insert eye roll</i></p>
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m not knocking the bottled water. It&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s not worth 50Y! </p>
<p>After this quick post and some email, we are off to the <a href="http://www.orientalplaza.com/en/malls/index.html">Oriental Plaza Mall</a> to buy a suitcase (for me) and possibly a duffle for Geoff. Yes, a suitcase. With wheels. </p>
<p>I decided that I&#8217;ve spent far too much on postage costs mailing stuff home, so a nice little suitcase will do the trick at this point. I&#8217;m close enough to home that schlepping it all over isn&#8217;t such a daunting process. Plus, I like the souvenir shopping. As Martha would say, it&#8217;s a good thing. </p>

<p>About the only thing Amy and I had on tap today was the Summer Palace. For this, we took three subways and a (decent) taxi to the location. Total cost: about 30 yuan, and about 30 minutes. The palace entrance was crowed with about half the population of Beijing, it seemed. High for a weekday, but we soon realized why&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;ve been storms here the last few days. Big ones. I haven&#8217;t heard a good thunderstorm in a long time. The rains, it seems, have washed away the all the haze and pollution that&#8217;s been hovering around the area for the last few days. (We should have gone to the Wall today, but c&#8217;est la vie.) This made The Summer Palace near perfect for visiting today. It wasn&#8217;t too hot, there was a great breeze (almost to the point of calling it &#8220;windy&#8221;) and the sky was actually blue (instead of the usual white with a blue tinge). </p>
<p>The Summer Palace was meant as a place for the royal family to escape the heat of the Forbidden City. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine why &#8212; all the walls there must prevent a good airflow. Out at the Summer Palace &#8212; easily three or four times the overall size &#8212; wind blows very easily. I&#8217;m almost surprised that the Forbidden City wasn&#8217;t just abandoned in favour of the Summer Palace. But that&#8217;s royalty for you&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03641.JPG" width="300" alt="Protect the railings!"></a></p>
<p>We wandered all the way around the main lake, a distance of about five kilometres or so. The willow trees drifted in the wind, the clouds scattered the shadows about. Children played at the water&#8217;s edge while countless tourists and locals tried to escape the inevitable heat of the day. It&#8217;s a park now, with a bit of museum thrown in for flavour. It&#8217;s 35 yuan (about CDN$6) and worth every penny of admission. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03642.JPG" width="300" alt="The Summer Palace in Beijing"></a></p>
<p>After our ripoff cab ride, we went in seach of dinner. The goal: Peking (Beijing) Duck. I&#8217;d had it before at Silver Dragon in Calgary, but Amy had never tried it before. We ended up at the same restaurant where we&#8217;d ate lunch about eight hours before, having ordered two places of potstickers that were easily three times the size of any I&#8217;d ever seen before (and boy, oh boy, were they good!). The place is down a back alley, on the second floor of an area that sells pretty much any food you can think of. The restaurant looks like an old community hall from Small Town Canada, and is sparsely decorated. That&#8217;s because the attention is put into the food. </p>
<p>The kung pow chicken was spicy, but tasty. The boiling wok of whatnot (mostly chicken, chilies, and celery) was yummy. The duck, which arrived 45 minutes after ordering, was great. You know you&#8217;re in a good place to order Peking Duck when it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not advertised outside the restaurant.</li>
<li>The restaurant doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8220;duck&#8221; written anywhere in it&#8217;s name, especially in English.</li>
<li>You see the locals ordering it.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/"><img src="../../../../media/DSC03643.JPG" width="300" alt="Peking Duck ... mmmmmm"></a></p>
<p>I currently bear the battle scars of grease on my shorts. It&#8217;s a sign that the meal was good. My stomach might forgive me tomorrow. I doubt I&#8217;ll eat for a day or so, though&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="post-126"><a href="/../../01/shifty-taxis-in-beijing/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Shifty taxis in Beijing">Shifty taxis in Beijing</a></h2>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So Amy and I decided to take a taxi back from the Summer Palace to our hotel. Partly because the walk around the Palace grounds (which are huge) wore us out, and partly because we couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get back to the subway station we&#8217;d taken the taxi from in the first place. </p>
<p>A warning, which will likely be universally understood by many travellers, some taxi drivers in Beijing are con artists. Well, more like would-be con artists, as to be a proper artist, you have to be accepted for your ability. The a-hole who decided to dupe us really didn&#8217;t come off that way. </p>
<p>As we&#8217;d exited the Summer Palace, this guy ran up to us with a card, said &#8220;meter!&#8221; (usually a good thing) and offered us his car. The card said &#8220;1.20&#8221;, which is supposed to be the rate per kilometre. At first, all was well. But by the time we hit the highway, I happened to notice that the fare was already 36 yuan, rather than a much lower (expected) rate. This set off my bulls**t alarm, and I started to watch the meter earnestly, commenting to Amy that we were getting hosed. </p>
<p>When we got to the hotel, the fare was 95 yuan for what shouldn&#8217;t have been more than about 60. We knew that by rough calculation. The driver tried to drop us off across the street from the hotel, but we directed him in (though he did try to avoid it). I guess he knew the jig was up when Amy called over one of the attendants who spoke English. (One advantage of a very nice hotel &#8212; staff who speak English quite well.) The driver offered 70. Given that he did get us there quickly, we agreed. </p>
<p>How do you tell if you&#8217;re about to be ripped off? Glance at the meter. It should be in clear view. There will likely be three numbers: the rate (1.20, 1.60, or 1.80), the kilometres driven (which we think was also rigged, so check with your guides), and the time spent waiting (this doesn&#8217;t seem to affect the fare much). Watch the rate &#8212; ours changed from 1.20 to 1.80 pretty much whenever the driver pushed down on the accelerator. </p>
<p>How to avoid? Peg the fare in advance before you leave, and write it down. Or use a taxi from a good hotel &#8212; they might cost a bit more, but they won&#8217;t pull silly buggers (as my dad used to say) with you. </p>

<p>OK, I just had to squee like <a href="http://www.yarnagogo.com">Rachael</a>&#8230; today was GOOD. </p>
<ol>
<li>We had perfect, and I mean <i>perfect</i> weather at the Summer Palace&#8230; warm but not hot, windy but not obnoxious, cloudy but only the fluffy pretty kind.</li>
<li>Another amazing dinner at a nondescript local restaurant. Peking Duck&#8230; amazing.</li>
<li>The hotel once again surpassed all my expectations. I had initially been disappointed that the <a href="http://www.hyatt.com">Hyatt</a> was sold out, but for a lower rate, we&#8217;ve had an excellent experience here. I will be back!</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../../../media/IMGA0245.JPG' alt='Me at the Summer Palace' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>And, onto Shanghai tomorrow. I will have better posts once I find a cheaper connection. </p>
