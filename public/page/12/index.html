<div class="storycontent">
<p>Oh, I feel so stuck. </p>
<p>This morning, we checked out of the hotel and checked our bags in the 24hour luggage center at the hotel. And then, we set out for a little walk, destination unknown. </p>
<p>We walked for about a block and a half, watched intently by military men, usually young boys around 20 or so. They stand at attention, watching the street and the sidewalk, every 10 feet. This goes on as far as the eye can see. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a lovely view of St. Basil&#8217;s Cathedral, from as close as we were allowed to go.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0134.JPG' alt='As Close to St. Basil\&#039;s...' width="300"></a></p>
<p>We reached the corner where the metro is and faced a line of them. Nyet. No further. Well, it looked like we could go into the metro, just that it would be hard getting back to the hotel. So that&#8217;s out of the question as our bags are here. </p>
<p>So, we walked in the other direction. Nyet. </p>
<p>Now we are in the hotel&#8217;s business centre, paying 5 rubles a minute for a slow internet connection that I can&#8217;t even connect my camera to. So, no photos today, sadly. </p>
<p>And I am sick. I have a cold. I&#8217;m sniffling and sneezing and coughing. This isn&#8217;t fair! I just got over the cold/flu 4 weeks ago in Calgary! Who would have thought I could get sick again! I&#8217;m normally pretty healthy.</p>
<p>But, to stop complaining for a moment&#8230;</p>
<p>Last night we went to Arbat street, as I think I posted last night, and had dinner at a great little Georgian restaurant. We were the only diners at 8:30. Our theory is that people here eat LATE, or maybe everyone went out of town (smartly) for the long holiday weekend. Regardless, the food was surpurb! </p>
<p>We each had a glass of Georgian wine (I had a delicious red), accompanied with a great beef soup filled with great spices and vegetables. And some fried cheese for an appetizer. My main course was pork and potato cooked in a spice mixture and served in a little bowl. I could eat this every day and never grow tired! </p>
<p>To be honest, the food here is a bit of a surprise. With the exception of the horrible buffet we tried in St. Petersburg, we&#8217;ve had some really fantastic meals. We&#8217;ve just had to pay for them. For example, last night was 700 rubles each&#8230; that&#8217;s about $35CAD. Which I guess it what you&#8217;d pay at home. Still, it seems pricey for the local economy where a metro ride is about 75 cents. </p>
<p>I am disappointed that we haven&#8217;t been able to see any of the festivities for Victory Day. I&#8217;m not sure who they were for, just press and dignitaries, etc, but I did expect some sort of parade or public thing at some point. Maybe we just don&#8217;t know where to look. </p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s now 1:30pm local time. I think after finishing up on the computer I&#8217;m going to find a comfy chair and pull out a book or my knitting and maybe get another coke. I have a theory that coke makes colds better. True, no? </p>

<p>Oy.</p>
<p>One of the few highlights of our time in Moscow was our impromptu visit to GUM, the old state department store, which has since been converted into a (very) upscale mall. However, I couldn&#8217;t have predicted this fantastic moment that we somehow stumbled into&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0116.JPG' alt='Acordian Veterans at GUM' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>Two WWII veterans playing accordian with a whole host of Israeli tourists. There was dancing, oh, was there dancing!</p>
<p>OK, I think Geoff just spent a page and a half ranting about how frustrating Moscow has been so I&#8217;ll keep this short (and positive). </p>
<ul>
<li>Moscow is not a pretty city, at least not traditionally. I thought the Arbat area was pretty nice. At least, it wasn&#8217;t quite so&#8230; drab.</li>
<li>Prices for entry are crazy. We paid 340 plus a photo fee of 100 for <b>The Armory</b> at the Kremlin. (I don&#8217;t think the actual grounds were open.) So, for about $22 Canadian EACH, we got to see a nice but small museum of tsarist treasures. Woo.</li>
<li>Internet cafes are incredibly hard to seek out, especially when half the streets are closed due to security.</li>
<li>Staying practically ON the Red Square is great, unless you&#8217;re visiting during a national holiday that&#8217;s practically shut down all access points to the Red Square. And oh yeah, I haven&#8217;t actually SEEN the Red Square except a corner of Lenin&#8217;s tomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I&#8217;m pretty disappointed by this, actually. I&#8217;ve seen bits and pieces of things here and there, but most of the &#8216;interesting&#8217; bits of Moscow are completely closed off. </p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll just have to come back some day. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Having enough of Moscow already, we headed out to Sergei Posad, formerly known as Zagorsk. One of the &#8220;Golden Ring&#8221; towns, Sergei Posad is only and hour and a half out of Moscow by wooden-benched passenger train. Fairly uncomfortable but only when packed to the gills as ours was both coming and going. </p>
<p>But it was worth it!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0118.JPG' alt='Sergiev Posad' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>We spent most of our day exploring the walled monastery in the town. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0117.JPG' alt='The ever-present head shot' width="300"></a></p>
<p>For women, you must wear a head scarf to go in any of the buildings, out of respect. I knew this but still left mine at home, so I picked up a Russian scarf in the local market for around $10. It&#8217;s quite pretty, but something about wearing it made it easy to sport a stoic scowl.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0126.JPG' alt='Head scarves make you scowl' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>What I liked most of all were the large variety of colours, shapes, and styles found on the various buildings. </p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Amy @ 5:11 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>It&#8217;s a miserable day here in St. Petersburg. It&#8217;s cold, damp, and alternating between a light drizzle and a full-on rainstorm. Not much good for doing outside things as we had planned. </p>
<p>So, it was an &#8220;errand&#8221; day. I went to the <a href="http://www.dhl.com">DHL</a> office (one block from our hostel) to post a 2kg package home. In it was most of the yarn I bought at <a href="http://www.liberty.co.uk/">Liberty</a> in London, plus a skirt and t-shirt, some socks, a present for Sandra, and a few guidebooks I no longer need. </p>
<p>We then stopped into a bookstore to check out some of the retro postcards &#8211; I&#8217;ll post photos once I get decent shots. Some were quite cool and would be nice framed. </p>
<p>And then, of course, souvenir shopping. Around the block from our hostel is a cute little souvenir shop that had better quality and lower prices than the stalls at Tsarskoe Celo / Pushkin yesterday. I fell in particular love with this small set of 5 <a href="http://www.russianlegacy.com/nestingdolls.htm">matryoshka</a> dolls&#8230; you&#8217;ll see why.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0099.JPG' alt='The full family' width="300"></a></p>
<p>The story is about three sisters. All of them were very kind and very talented. They went to bed at night, always dreaming of the day they would marry and be rich. One of the sisters was especially talented. She spun her own yarn from wool and made her own clothing by knitting and weaving beautiful fabrics. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0095.JPG' alt='First set of dolls' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>One day, she was out in the forest and fell into a magical well. On the other side, she found a &#8220;magic grandfather&#8221; who took her into his house. She worked for some time, carrying water from the well, doing housework and taking care of the old man. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0097.JPG' alt='Down the well' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Her hard work paid off. After some time, he said she was the best and kindest young woman, and she was worthy to receive 3 wishes. She wished for love, happiness and wealth. The wishes came true (of course), and she lived happily ever after with her sweetheart in a beautiful castle.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0098.JPG' alt='Happily Ever After' width="300"> </a></p>

<p>One of the unexpected things about travelling&#8230; something I didn&#8217;t realize before&#8230; is how attached you can become to a few of the gems you meet along the way. When you go out for a few evenings with new friends, having absolutely fantastic, intelligent, interesting discussions&#8230; well&#8230; this makes it hard to move on. </p>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing what we can of Moscow, but I do hate to leave this great hostel and these great new friends. Hopefully our paths will cross again some day. In any case, it&#8217;s been a total blast!</p>
<p>Other things I&#8217;ve discovered in the last 24 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve either lost 10 pounds or it&#8217;s time to wash these jeans back into shape</li>
<li>It is indeed possible for blisters to breed</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not <i>actually</i> addicted to diet coke, as proven by the fact that I&#8217;ve gone two days without and haven&#8217;t seen one withdrawl symptom</li>
<li>My pack is still way too heavy</li>
</ul>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Amy @ 8:37 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Staying &#8220;home&#8221; yesterday afternoon and resting/reading/knitting/watching my video reel so far was probably the best thing I could have done. While the Hermitage left me nearly in tears at lunchtime, shortly after dinner, I was ready to hit the town again. </p>
<p>Geoff, Nick and I went out to get some sushi for dinner. I know, not exactly Russian. But there&#8217;s a Japanese restaurant on nearly every other streetcorner here in St. Petersburg! It&#8217;s an epidemic I&#8217;ll gladly say &#8220;Da!&#8221; to. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I&#8217;m hoping Geoff blogged about it more, but the sushi was pretty good, and even Nick the Newbie loved it!</p>
<p>On our way, though, we stopped by the Church on Spilled Blood to snap some photos in the great afternoon/evening light. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0072.JPG' alt='Me at the Church on Spilled Blood' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>I love how this one turned out. I didn&#8217;t have my film camera with me, for once, which is a shame. I&#8217;m sure Geoff has some great ones though. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0074.JPG' alt='Cool view of church' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>After dinner, we headed back to the hostel to pick up our tripods and night equipment to get some shots of the monuments, buildings, and bridges illuminated for the night. </p>
<p>I went through a roll and a half of film, and spent a lot of time experimenting with shutter speed, so whether anything will turn out is a bit of a gamble. With any luck, I&#8217;ll have one or two great ones! </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0077.JPG' alt='Winter Palace at Night' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Of course, the evening didn&#8217;t end there. We saw a sign advertising the Tinkhoff Microbrewery and couldn&#8217;t resist. Once clearing security and checking our coats (both traditions we&#8217;ve already learned from every public building and museum we&#8217;ve visited), we grabbed a picnic table in a stylishly decorated old warehouse and sampled some of their beers. I&#8217;m not sure whether any were brewed on site in St. Petersburg or not. They have about 10 locations across Russia, including locations in Moscow, Kazan and Yekaterinburg. So, doubtless, we&#8217;ll be trying to find another location in a few days. (Their food menu looked fantastic as well!)</p>
<p>Fast forward to this morning, and you&#8217;ll find Geoff and I practically running out of the hostel to avoid our new roommate, Helga. (Long story, I might get into it tomorrow. Otherwise, ask me.)</p>
<p>We tried to make the 9:58 train to Pushkin, but were about 20 minutes late, so bought tickets for the 11:58 and then sat in the waiting hall to wait it out. While Geoff wrote a bit, I worked on my current knitted object du jour; this little green mohair wrap sweater. It weighs less than my iPod! (Not really, but it&#8217;s close!)</p>
<p>A bit later, we were riding a train with uncomfortable wooden planks for seats. They had backs, but were hardly comfortable as more and more people squeezed on. After 30 minutes, we arrived at Pushkin, site of Catherine the Great&#8217;s favorite home. </p>
<p>On the way, we befriended a german couple, and walked to the park as a group. Just the walk to the park was almost enough to wear me out. Check out the size of this place!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0082.JPG' alt='Man this park is big!' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say we really did it justice. We quickly split up, and Geoff and I wandered the area immediately surrounding the Great Palace for some photography, of course. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0091.JPG' alt='Look, it\&#039;s a big blue palace!' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a nice view of the courtyard that&#8217;s technically the front of the palace, I think. At least, this is where carriages would pull up, back in the day. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0092.JPG' alt='And now, the money shot' width="300"> </a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t go in. Even though it was open today, we were told tickets wouldn&#8217;t be on sale until 4pm, for some reason. Since it was only 2 and we were starving and not looking forward to the nearly $17 entrance fee (each!), we left in search of blini. </p>
<p>Blini are wonderful, as I&#8217;ve discovered. They are like crepes, but heartier, and folded into a square pouch. I&#8217;ve only had the &#8220;buttered&#8221; version so far, but would like to try jam, or anything that does NOT involve sour cream! (I know, I know&#8230; when in Rome and all that.) </p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve learned a few valuable lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Down coats are perfect travelling companions &#8211; thanks Sandra! They make a great pillow, blanket, or coat, and they smush up into next to nothing in your pack.</li>
<li>I packed way too much yarn  &#8211; sending some of it home today.</li>
<li>Free laundry, free internet, and free international phone calls make a hostel that&#8217;s nearly heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, and when Geoff was here 16 years ago&#8230;</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha!</p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 12:09 pm </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Hard. Really hard. </p>
<p>Amy and I got here yesterday morning, but you&#8217;d be surprised how hard it is to find an internet cafe. Our hotel, Rossiya, despite being the largest hotel in Europe (which, incidentally, isn&#8217;t remotely as cool as it sounds), doesn&#8217;t have jack sqwat. </p>
<p>Tonight, roaming around Arbat Street, we got lucky. </p>
<p>Why is it so hard? Security in Moscow is tight &#8212; insanely so. There&#8217;s a massive 24-hour cafe not too far from our hotel, but right in the middle of the two-block-plus radius they&#8217;ve locked down. Unless you&#8217;re in the security force or the military, you ain&#8217;t getting anywhere near Red Square. </p>
<p>Why the big hullaballoo? The 60th anniversary of Victory Day is tomorrow, and the world has taken notice. (Why, we don&#8217;t know.) We even saw a bus dedicated to the Indian media here to cover the stories. It&#8217;s wild. Red Square: locked down. GUM: locked out (at least today, we got in yesterday). Kremlin: forget it. Even the Bolshoi is out for the count. </p>
<p>I suppose it&#8217;s necessary. Even the Shrub (aka President of the United States of America) is hitting town for this, and without question the Russian government wants this to be a top-notch show. I think even the grass is being hand-cut for consistency. </p>
<p>Even on Arbat Street, some distance away, there are a lot of guards. No hassling, mind you &#8212; just keeping an eyeful watch. Which is good, because I gather Moscow police have a habit of hassling tourists. </p>
<p>Either way, Amy and I are grateful for leaving Moscow tomorrow. It&#8217;s boring here. I never particularly liked Moscow to begin with, but with everything closed, it&#8217;s even more boring than usual. We&#8217;re off for Kazan, which should be an interesting day stop before going onto Ekaterinburg. </p>
<p>Time&#8217;s running out on this computer, though &#8212; we want to get back to the (relative) safety of our hotel, just in case security gets even tighter. </p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 11:03 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>It was a rainy day when my brother Raoul&#8230; no, wait, sorry &#8212; that&#8217;s a Pizzaville ad. </p>
<p>But it was a rainy day here (the rain only recently finally stopped). Amy and I were going to do the church tour today, but walking to the Peter and Paul Fortress would have soaked us through. Not really an option.  Instead, we opted for the <a href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/st-isaacs-cathedral.asp">St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral</a>, about a click down the road. </p>
<p>The last time I saw St. Isaac&#8217;s, it was still in need of work. It&#8217;s one of the largest and tallest buildings in St. Petersburg, and its golden dome was used by the Nazis for shelling the then Leningrad. The photos of the church&#8217;s history show that by the end of the war, St. Isaac&#8217;s was little more than a jagged shell of its former glory. </p>
<p>In 1989, bullet holes were still present in the outer walls and columns. Much of the interior had been somewhat repaired, but it was a far cry from complete. In 1997, a massive restoration project restored the church back to its pre-WWII beauty. </p>
<p>For 440 rubles, you can scamper up a tall, circular staircase to the colonnade to see the St. Petersburg skyline (it&#8217;s quite breathtaking from up there), visit the museum, and shoot non-professional photos (basically, you&#8217;re not using a tripod). It&#8217;s pricey, but it&#8217;s worth it. The interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s alone is worth it &#8212; I have no idea how much they spent on the work, but the results speak for themselves. </p>
<p>The interior is gorgeous. Allow me to show you a few things. First, the holy interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03548.JPG" width="300" alt="The holy interior of St. Isaac's Cathedral"></a></p>
<p>The holy dome of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03549.JPG" width="300" alt="The holy dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral"></a></p>
<p>The holy altar of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03551.JPG" width="300" alt="The holy altar of St. Isaac's Cathedral"></a></p>
<p>The holy candle room of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03552.JPG" width="300" alt="The holy candle room of St. Isaac's Cathedral"></a></p>
<p>The holy ATM of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03550.JPG" width="300" alt="The holy ATM of St. Isaac's Cathedral"></a></p>
<p>(Yeah, that was a little weird to see.) </p>
<p>Amy opted not to climb the collonade, so finished with the museum (the rest of the church) by the time I got there. We met up afterwards in the Astoria Hotel for tea. Sheerly lethal sweets, I might add (the chocolate mousse was enough to make me cry). A little indulgence for such a wet day. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03553.JPG" width="300" alt="Tea at the Astoria Hotel"></a></p>
<p>We returned to the hostel for a while before wandering back out to the Palace Square to see what was going on out there. The military have been practicing for a few days for the big celebrations on 9 May (60 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany). They were apparently pretty bad on Wednesday. Not too bad today, though I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t appreciate being in the rain. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03554.JPG" width="300" alt="Military drills in Palace Square"></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re getting ready for our train to Moscow tonight. We leave in about two hours. We can only hope we&#8217;re not trapped in a cabin with vodka-toting Russians. Our new Israeli roommate took all day to recover from his sojourn here yesterday as a result of that&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Turns out that our excursion to Tinkoff to discuss politics turned into a football lesson. (That&#8217;s &#8220;football&#8221; as in how the rest of the world defines &#8220;soccer&#8221; for us North Americans.) Kat and Nick are huge fans. So large, as a matter of fact, that Kat is delaying her departure to Khazakstan so she can catch the cup game her favourite team will be playing. </p>
<p>I tried to have Kat explain to me the whole cup/league thing for &#8220;final&#8221; games, and to her credit, she tried. It didn&#8217;t sink in. </p>
<p>Tinkoff was also broadcasting games between St. Petersburg and Moscow, and between Russia and Italy. A group of fairly drunk Russians in the back kept trying to sing the &#8220;Ole, ole, ole, ole&#8221; chant often heard in football games, but were either so drunk they couldn&#8217;t sing or were utterly tone deaf.</p>
<p>Then it was on to music. Nick&#8217;s a music fiend. He has a lot of exposure to music of many types, which led to a few interesting arguments about who was good and who wasn&#8217;t. The different perspectives are definitely interesting to hear. </p>
<p>I was accused of starting some of these conversations because I had something to day. I suppose that&#8217;s true, and anyone who knows me knows that I do usually need to open my big yapper. But it was unintentional &#8212; I like to see where conversation goes. </p>

<p>The CSS issues have been bugging me since San Francisco, but it&#8217;s only today that I got around to fixing &#8217;em. </p>
<p>While I&#8217;m waiting for Amy to get up and running, I took a stab at the <code>.center</code> class that was screwing up the border for the prev/next links. Turns out that I&#8217;d unwittingly defined <code>.center</code> to have the same attributes as the major classes, which meant a cascade error was bound to occur. </p>
<p>I unbundled it from the others (though kept some of the root attributes) and reset the width to something a little more manageable. My apologies for not fixing this sooner. </p>
