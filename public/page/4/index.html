<div class="storycontent">
<p>So, I&#8217;m sitting in a knock-off Starbucks that has free internet terminals, sipping a frozen peach milkshake thing and listening to John Denver&#8217;s &#8220;Rocky Mountain High&#8221; on the radio. Have I mentioned I&#8217;m in Hong Kong?!?!?</p>
<p>I had my first (and only) fitting for the dress just now. Man is it beautiful. And I look very very skinny! The dress isn&#8217;t for the wedding ceremony, but probably for the rehearsal dinner or some other such occasion. It&#8217;s so gorgeous. And the bonus is they are going to ship it home for me so I don&#8217;t have to carry it! Hopefully I don&#8217;t get dinged on customs and duty, but it&#8217;s so beautiful. Have I mentioned how gorgeous it is?!?!?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still enjoying Hong Kong immensely. I even managed to find some clothing that fits me, even if it was at Marks &amp; Spencer, a British department store. And it&#8217;s so hot I&#8217;m sweating from every pore on my body. Not so attractive. I&#8217;m hoping that a cute flouncy cotton skirt and tee shirt helps distract the world from my sweaty, ugly, ragged mess. Doubtful, but a girl can hope!</p>
<p>So, Geoff is off running some errands and I&#8217;m scheduled to meet up with him around 7 or 7:30 at an Irish pub here in Soho. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s so odd, I can&#8217;t get over how British this place is. I know, it&#8217;s not really a surprise. After travelling for six weeks through Russia, Siberia, Mongolia, and Mainland China, I can say with total conviction that I am suffering from <i>culture shock</i>. </p>
<p>In addition to the oddity of hearing English spoken everywhere, listening to English songs on the radio, and seeing English-language newspapers on every street corner, there&#8217;s the sticker shock. For comparison, in mainland China, a bottle of Tsing Tao cost about 4Y at the store or anything from 4-12Y at a restaurant. In USD, that&#8217;s between $0.50 and $3.00. Here, a bottle of Tsing Tao is 12HKD at the store and upwards of 40HKD at the restaurant. That&#8217;s between $2.00 and $6.00. I know, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a big difference. But when you consider that it&#8217;s just one example, and that everything except public transportation seems to suffer from the same horrible ratio&#8230; Hong Kong is much more expensive than I had guessed. </p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s all the British and Australian and Americans here. There are white people everywhere! I&#8217;m not getting stared at any more! I can communicate in my native language! It&#8217;s so weird. </p>
<p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t been to Asia, I highly suggest Hong Kong as a fabulous but easy introduction. It&#8217;s safe here, the food is great, the people are friendly. There are lots of &#8220;shades of home&#8221; but at the same time, you never forget you&#8217;re in Asia. I love it. </p>
<p>After sitting for a half hour in air conditioned bliss, I think it&#8217;s time to head back out into the hot humid world. 6pm, one more hour to kill. Shopping? I think so!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve successfully made my way through Russia, where if you drink a drop of the tap water or even brush your teeth in it, you run the risk of contacting some fairly nasty stomach bugs. Sick? Not even once. </p>
<p>In Mongolia, I drank fermented mare&#8217;s milk as prepared by a local nomadic family. I tried unpasteurized but very fresh goat&#8217;s milk yogurt. I ate some dodgy looking mutton, although I&#8217;d rather forget that. Sick? Not a chance. </p>
<p>In mainland China, I ate everything I could find, dumpings in night markets, more dumplings in street stalls, even dumplings from the local 7-11 store. Sick? Hah! </p>
<p>But in Hong Kong I have one short Vanilla Latte and my record is blown. </p>
<p>Sick? Absolutely. </p>
<p>Flat 7-Up and Gatorade here I come. And hoping tomorrow is better.</p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/china/index.html" rel="category tag">China</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Amy @ 11:01 pm </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>After 27 hours on the overnight train from Xian, followed by a frenetic 2 hours in Guangzhou&#8217;s train stations (central <i>and</i> east), we hopped on the express through train and made it to Kowloon 2 hours later. Looking at the Lonely Planet map, it wasn&#8217;t immediately obvious how we would make it across the harbour to Hong Kong Island and the Cosmopolitan Hotel. </p>
<p>However, there were helpful signs that led us here, with a short little walk. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0287.JPG' alt='First view of Victoria Harbour' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>I had managed to wash my hair in the train sink that morning, but even so, it was good to be breathing fresh, if incredibly humid, air once again. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0288.JPG' alt='Happy to be off the train' width="300"></a> </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0291.JPG' alt='Pretty buildings' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>The harbour is even busier than you could imagine. Ships everywhere, loading containers, ferrying passengers, you name it!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0292.JPG' alt='Lots of ships' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted a photo of by &#8220;Barbie&#8221; suitcase. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0290.JPG' alt='My barbie suitcase' width="300"></a>  </p>
<p>When she&#8217;s sitting next to my army-green rugged Eagle Creek backpack, I call it the &#8220;butch-femme&#8221; luggage set. Nice, eh? I joke, but really, the pink and grey rolling case is pretty nice looking and decently made. It&#8217;s a bit of a pain to lug around, but it was less than half what shipping the souvenirs from Mongolia would have cost. So I&#8217;m not really complaining. I also have things organized now so that all the souvenirs and things I don&#8217;t need go in the backpack and my everyday stuff is stashed in the suitcase. It&#8217;s much easier to pack. </p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s now the second day in Hong Kong and we&#8217;ve wandered ourselves silly for a few hours. The first stop was &#8220;Shanghai Tang&#8221;, a modern twist on traditional Chinese style. We both came away with some nice souvenirs. I was tempted by the dresses, but knew none of them would fit anyway. (More on this topic later.)</p>
<p>Next up, an alley lined with photography stores. Geoff had been looking for a replacement lens for his camera for awhile but with no luck any time in the past few weeks. After some false positives, he still didn&#8217;t find the one he was hoping for. So we moved on. Our intended next-up was a Dim Sum restaurant the Lonely Planet had raved about. We found it with minimal fuss, but as it turns out, they only serve Dim Sum after 2pm. </p>
<p>So, up the street and down some other roads we went until we found a little sidewalk bar/cafe where we ordered some interestingly named (&#8220;Black Sheep Brewing Company&#8221;) ales and a plate of potato skins to tide us over until Dim Sum. Of course, now I feel so full I can&#8217;t imagine scarfing down dumplings and buns, potstickers and spare ribs. Maybe in a few hours? </p>
<p>And finally, the Linva Tailor in Soho. Linva is recommended in the Lonely Planet as a place to have a cheong sam (traditional Chinese dress) custom made. So, I picked out fabric, and got measured, put down a hefty deposit and agreed to come back tomorrow at 5pm for a fitting. I guess tomorrow won&#8217;t be beach day after all. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m just hoping it turns out well and is flattering. I&#8217;m not feeling all that positive about my body image right now, so with any luck, this will be a good decision and not a waste of time and money. I have something pretty appropriate picked out for the occasion, so here&#8217;s hoping!</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Sigh. </p>
<p>Our last overnight train. </p>
<p>27 hours in soft sleeper. This time, without cabinmates. And the others in our train car were so quiet. The journey was peaceful. Almost perfect. (Don&#8217;t remind me about that slop they have the nerve to call &#8220;beer&#8221;!!!!! Next time, I will run in the other direction instead of forking down nearly $1CAD for the can.)</p>
<p>We left Xian around 9am, so we had all day to appreciate the Chinese countryside. This isn&#8217;t the most thrilling photo, but I can assure you, the views were more picturesque than Siberia! (Go figure!) Lack of birch trees aside, I did enjoy seeing the countryside slowly shift from wheat fields to rice terraces and banana trees. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0283.JPG' alt='Chinese countryside' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>The interior of a Chinese train is much the same as a Russian one, except lighter. The walls are light &#8220;wood&#8221; or white instead of dark, and the floors are lighter as well. This train was also quite a bit roomier than all of our previous trips. I swear we had an additional 18 inches in the aisle between the two sets of bunks! </p>
<p>One habit I&#8217;ve gotten into is clipping my iPod onto the little mesh shelf above my bunk. It&#8217;s the perfect place for it while I&#8217;m lying in my bunk reading or writing or knitting. It&#8217;s handy but never lost. I think Apple should sell the iPod with this caribener clip instead of the dorky neck strap. It&#8217;s much more useful. And it sort of looks like an IV drip hanging like that. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0284.JPG' alt='My ipod' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>As a side note, I have about 240 songs on there. And I&#8217;m <i>just now</i> getting to the point of being fed up with half of them. Not bad. </p>
<p>My only real complaint about the Chinese trains is that instead of providing a little step ladder to the upper bunks, they give you one 3 inch square step. It&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s useless. Look how far down it is!!!!</p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/china/index.html" rel="category tag">China</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Amy @ 10:03 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Now firmly ensconced in Hong Kong, it seems odd, irreverant even, to be writing about Xian, an ancient capital city of mainland China. </p>
<p>But here I go. </p>
<p>And also, I have to add, I think that Geoff has only beaten me on the content front because he has posted many more photos than I have. Sometimes, this has been a connectivity issue. And sometimes, I&#8217;ve just been lazy or constrained by my 8MB of SDRAM. So I&#8217;ve committed this to be the entry with the most photos&#8230; I mean&#8230; ahem&#8230; why does everything have to be a competition? </p>
<p>So, where did I leave off? </p>
<p>Oh yes. It was raining in Xian. Raining a lot. My nice waterproof North Face jacket worked well, except for the parts that weren&#8217;t covered, like my legs and feet. Geoff had an umbrella from the hotel so he was in much the same position I was. Sopping wet from the knees down. </p>
<p>But eventually, the rain stopped and we were left with a lovely night for a walk around Xian&#8217;s historic (and mostly complete) city walls. </p>
<p>Our hotel was located 500m or so from the walls on the South side, so we walked down until we had crossed just under a gate, and then walked West until we found the massive South Gate. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0260.JPG' alt='The South Gate at night' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>Good lighting, eh? One thing I noticed almost immediately is that Xian is not nearly as accustomed to foreign visitors as Beijing and Shanghai, and even Tianjin. We got many many more stares and interested looks than ever before, especially when we pulled out our cameras and tripods for this shot. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0261.JPG' alt='Another nice view' width="300"></a></p>
<p>The next morning, we headed out on our one and only group bus tour of this trip. The &#8220;Eastern&#8221; tour run by CITS goes to the famed Terra-cotta Warriors, just outside of Xian, but also stops at a few other key tourist sites. It&#8217;s a bit more pricey that doing it by public transport, but we were able to see way more than we could have covered in a single day on our own. </p>
<p>One of my major apprehensions is that we wouldn&#8217;t have enough time at the key sites on our own. Not so! The schedule felt very comfortable &#8211; a great mix between guided information and wandering time. </p>
<p>Our first stop was the &#8220;Big Wild Goose Pagoda&#8221;, 5km south of the city walls in Xian. This Buddhist temple complex was named after a Buddhist story that tells of starving monks who prayed and prayed for meat. One day, a big wild goose fell from the sky and died at their feet. They considered this a sign from the gods, a test, and from that day forward, became vegetarians. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0262.JPG' alt='The Big Wild Goose Pagoda' width="300"></a></p>
<p>The Pagoda itself has 7 stories. We climbed them all. I was told it was 264 stairs. It felt like 2,640,000. But who&#8217;s counting?</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0264.JPG' alt='Big Wild Goose Again' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Surrounding the Pagoda are several smaller temple buildings and nice gardens, such as the ones shown here. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0265.JPG' alt='Standard Tourist Shot' width="300"></a></p>
<p>As usual, I took way more photos with my film camera. But I think you get the idea. </p>
<p>Next up was the Terra-cotta Factory on the outskirts of Xian. Our guide explained that we stop at the factory to see how the Terra-cotta warriors were originally made. I think it was a thinly veiled &#8220;shopping opportunity&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not really complaining. </p>
<p>They had several rows of life-size warriors. And, like the real thing that we were about to see, these warriors were also all unique. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0266.JPG' alt='At the Terracotta Factory' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>Just ouside the door was a stack of old and unused molds. They looked pretty interesting. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0269.JPG' alt='When they made you, they broke the mold' width="300"></a></p>
<p>We also got a quick lesson on how the warriors were made. These shelves have partially completed small souvenir warriors. I may have bought one or two. Maybe. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0270.JPG' alt='The assembly line' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Admittedly, the next stop at the former Imperial Hot Springs wasn&#8217;t high on my list, but it was pretty, and it was a short stop. The spa looked really nice, but there wasn&#8217;t time for pampering.  </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0271.JPG' alt='At the hot springs' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>And finally, the piece de resistance, the Terra-cotta Warriors. </p>
<p>The museum grounds are fairly vast. Three main pits of warriors have been opened to the public. Additionally, they have a building for a 360 &#8220;Circle-Vision&#8221; movie and small souvenir stands (of course). There&#8217;s also a museum-like building for housing additional rotating exhibits. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0279.JPG' alt='The museum grounds' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Going into the Pit 1 &#8211; the largest pit &#8211; it was easy to be overwhelmed by the number of visitors! </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0276.JPG' alt='So many people!!!!!' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>I eventually pushed and elbowed my way to the edge of the bar to take a few photos. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0272.JPG' alt='Many many many terracotta warriors' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Really, these photos can&#8217;t possibly convey how breath-taking this sight was, so many rows of these life-size statues, set up in formation, ready for their General&#8217;s command. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0273.JPG' alt='Another standard tourist shot' width="300"></a></p>
<p>It was easy to see why this is one of the Wonders of the world. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0275.JPG' alt='Closer view' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a good photo of it, but the other two pits were left in mostly un-excavated form. (Probably because they are still working on them!) After seeing Pit 1, which has been reconstructed from the remains they found, it was pretty fascinating to see the smaller works-in-progress. </p>
<p>After another hour in the bus, we headed back to the hotel and then out for dinner &#8211; lunch had been provided as part of the tour but was utterly forgettable. </p>
<p>Instead of walking left out of the hotel as we had done the night before, we turned right and then right again down a streeet we had passed on the bus that morning. </p>
<p>We found our way into a two-story restaurant that was packed with locals &#8211; always a good sign. It turns out this was a &#8220;hot pot&#8221; restaurant. Originally a Mongolian dish prepared by nomadic soldiers in their metal helmets over a fire, the &#8220;hot pot&#8221; has definitely been adopted and modified by the Chinese. </p>
<p>We chose from a menu that was provided to us &#8211; in English &#8211; in a Microsoft Excel worksheet on someone&#8217;s laptop. I kid you not. It only had a few options, so we chose the &#8220;Aquatic Hotpot&#8221;, which I hoped meant a seafood stock, beef, shrimp, potato and radish. </p>
<p>The stock portion of the hot pot is brought to the table in a metal vat, which is placed on the gas burner at the table&#8217;s centre. The waiter turns on the gas and the stock boils in about 10 minutes. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0280.JPG' alt='The \&quot;aquatic\&quot; hot pot' width="300"></a></p>
<p>Then, the waiter brings out the plates of food ordered. The beef was raw, the shrimp cooked, and the radish and potato partially cooked. It all goes into the pot. When it&#8217;s cooked, you pull it out, a piece at a time, and drop it in a cup of cooled broth and herbs until it&#8217;s cool enough to eat. </p>
<p>The end result is amazing. I don&#8217;t know why this hasn&#8217;t caught on in Canada! Or maybe it has, but I&#8217;ve never seen it. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0281.JPG' alt='Mmmm... beef' width="300"></a> </p>
<p>And so ends our brief stay in Xian. I think it was a good choice to compliment the modernly-historic capital Beijing and the commercial and technological Shanghai. I do wish we had had more time to visit a smaller town in mainland China. At almost 7 million, I don&#8217;t think Xian qualifies. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>We&#8217;re cursed. It&#8217;s the only way to explain it. </p>
<p>Since arriving in China, one of the few things we&#8217;ve been absolutely obsessed over finding is some <em>authentic</em> dim sum. For us, this means a seating hall of about 4,000 or so, insanely noisy, carts trundling every which way, and no menu. Oh, and a place <strong>PACKED</strong> full of people. </p>
<p>You&#8217;d think, that in a country of China&#8217;s size, we&#8217;d find one? </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had dim sum, now, twice. The first time at our first hotel in Beijing. Very unsatisfying. The second time was after our current hotel in Hong Kong (we&#8217;re now just checking out for another one; we got this one to cover the days extra in HK) recommended one that doesn&#8217;t seem to exist. Either that or the concierge is a moron who doesn&#8217;t understand that when you recommend something, you have to know where it is! </p>
<p>The food was good, but it was off a menu. And no carts. </p>
<p>One way or another, we will find proper dim sum!</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>We haven&#8217;t been here long, but there&#8217;s already a few interesting things that are, well, interesting. Consider for the moment the fact that we&#8217;ve been running through three very different countries from what we expect to see at home: Russia, Mongolia, and China. For many of us, China will at least seem familiar, only from possibly walking through our respective Chinatowns or our favourite Chinese restaurant. Be rest assured, your favourite Chinese restaurant probably has little to do (or in common) with some of the places we&#8217;ve been&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also fair to say that the Russian places are totally different. Mongolia, don&#8217;t even get me started. </p>
<p>But Hong Kong is a strange parallel of familiarity and complete opposite. It&#8217;s a Chinese province, for all intents and purposes. But it&#8217;s also London, sufficiently removed and deposited halfway around the world. That doesn&#8217;t make a heap of sense in some cases, as I haven&#8217;t really been to British colonies before. But in a way it also makes sense. The British, during their colonial days, were very keen on overlaying their system on top of others&#8217;. And with Hong Kong, they quite literally had free reign (and a clean slate) to do so. Today, Hong Kong is a wide diversity of Chinese and English that seem to thrive together in some strange sort of tango. </p>
<p>Many of the roads bear names such as &#8220;Chater&#8221;, &#8220;Queens St.&#8221;, and other Anglicized names. It&#8217;s odd. But go far enough, and you&#8217;ll find the Chinese names. Certainly, this applies on Hong Hong Island, which is more English than Chinese. Skip across to Kowloon (which we really haven&#8217;t seen yet), and it&#8217;s more Chinese than English. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how that changes in the times to come. </p>
<p>A few things that haven&#8217;t changed include driving on the left side of the road, and using the imperial measurement system instead of Metric. </p>
<p>And things here are <em>expensive</em>. I&#8217;ve just succumbed to the sticker shock, and Amy might soon find me really annoying because of a desire to avoid racking up huge bills here. I have bills at home to pay&#8230; </p>
<p>Anyway, getting kicked off this computer, so no more for now&#8230;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>So naturally, upon arrival, we needed to get some money out so we could, well, do anything. The bank machine (from the Bank of China) set the minimum amount of HK$500 (a little less than CDN$100). Imagine my surprised when, on the $500 bill, there reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>
BANK OF CHINA<br>
Promises to pay to the bearer<br>
on demand at its office in Hong Kong</p>
<p>FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS<br>
HONG KONG DOLLARS</p>
<p>By order of the Board of Directors
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03685.JPG" width="300" alt="A HK$500 bill"></a> </p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t even sure if this was real money, or some kooky promisory note! (Turns out, it&#8217;s real&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03683.JPG" width="300" alt="A HK$100 bill"></a> </p>
<p>But imagine my <em>FURTHER</em> surprise when I look at the goofy set of $20 bills. Under most countries, the paper currency is issued only by the central bank, e.g. the United States Mint, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and so forth. But here in Hong Kong, it seems just about anyone can do it. So far, I&#8217;ve got <strong>five</strong> different $20 from three different banks: Bank of China, HSBC, and Standard Chartered Bank. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03684.JPG" width="300" alt="An array of HK$20 bills"></a> </p>

<p>We took our final long-distance train from Xian to Guangzhou yesterday, arriving this morning.

<h2 id="post-147"><a href="/2005/06/06/147/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Xian and the Terra Cotta Warriors">Xian and the Terra Cotta Warriors</a></h2>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/china/index.html" rel="category tag">China</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 9:42 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Amy and I have gone to some lengths to avoid doing the largely tourist thing: travelling in a tour group. Why? Because this is a trip we&#8217;ve both planned, and travelling with a group really wasn&#8217;t part of the plan. However, as we&#8217;d come to find out, getting to see the Terra Cotta warriors in Xian pretty much required a group. </p>
<p>In retrospect, this is all bunk. You don&#8217;t need one. It&#8217;s just cheaper. Theoretically. </p>
<p>So we were plucked from our hotel by a CITS (China Internal Tourist Service) bus that whisked us away to parts scheduled: the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, a Hot Springs (historical value), and the Warriors. One place unscheduled: a factory that makes souvenir terra cotta warriors. For tourists, of course. </p>
<p>The CITS tour is, of course, run by the government, which means that the tour guide is government-approved, which means that they follow the party line. That means communist. That means an interesting slant put on things religion- or belief-based. </p>
<p>Big Wild Goose Pagoda is only a part of the temple complex it sits in the middle of. But it is impressive, at 62 (or 64, depending on who&#8217;s right) metres tall. You get quite a good look from way up there. The rest of the grounds are quite nice too, even though it is quite a hike from the walled part of Xian. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03665.JPG" width="300" alt="Big Wild Goose Pagoda"></a> </p>
<p>Having seen the temple (and pagoda), and been delivered the official China Communist Party Line on the state of buddhism in the country, we offed to the eastern edge of town and the terra cotta factory. Pretty typical for what one would expect for a tourist factory making terra cotta warriors. And a steal at 40% off the marked price because we were tourists! [Insert sarcasm here. As if the prices weren&#8217;t already suitably marked up to begin with.]</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03666.JPG" width="300" alt="Terra Cotta Warrior Reproductions"></a> </p>
<p>The Hot Springs (forget the name, but they sit at the foot of Li Shan mountain) were nice, especially for the historical aspect (the Emperors of China built their winter palaces here), and the gardens were pretty. We stayed not very long. </p>
<p>I was waiting for the Terra Cotta Warriors. Ever since I&#8217;d first read about them, I&#8217;d wanted to see them. Imagine how one person, thousands of years ago, had commanded that he be buried with thousands of individual terra cotta statues of people, to command in the afterlife! The were lost to antiquity after revolts supposedly destroyed everything (so we were told), but a farmer found them when digging a well. Today, there is quite the complex there to preserve the sites and continue the archeological dig. </p>
<p>Walking into the Pit 1 building (the names of the three sites are very original, I&#8217;ll leave the remaining two buildings to your imagination) was something else. Two football fields (pick your variation), easily. It&#8217;s hard to imagine how something like this was built. But it was. And the fact that it was found was also amazing. This is something to be left intact &#8212; it&#8217;s probably a good thing the warriors weren&#8217;t discovered until well after the so-called Cultural Revolution. </p>
