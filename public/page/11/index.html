<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/trains/index.html" rel="category tag">Train Stuff</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Amy @ 2:11 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Oh Kazan, how did I love thee? Let me count the ways&#8230;</p>
<p>Kazan was the most perfect day-long break from our crazy itinerary. We had bright blue skies, an atmospheric alley cafe in a hidden courtyard, glittering mosque domes, and an overall fabulous day. </p>
<p>Anyone who does the trans-sib or trans-mongolian should not miss Kazan! We couldn&#8217;t even get into the Kremlin because it&#8217;s under construction, but even without being able to see the buildings up close from inside the walls, it was still a fabulous day. </p>
<p>Just before getting on the train, we stopped by the &#8220;central market&#8221; about 200m south of the station. Our intention was to pick up some snacks for the train, and dinner, but in addition to a bag of peanuts, some candy, and bottled water, I ended up with 1kg of 2ply wool. Geoff hopefully got some good shots of the transaction. I was trying to ask if they had any really skinny wool yarn, but they thought I wanted 2ply instead of 3ply (which IS skinnier!), and anyhow, you&#8217;ll never guess how much the whole pack cost me&#8230;</p>
<p>100rubles.</p>
<p>About $4.00CAD or $3.00US.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow. Wow. Wow. </p>
<p>So, next time Geoff is going to haul out the video camera and get the thing on tape too. Let&#8217;s just say there was a LOT of giggling from both sides!</p>
<p>The only problem with buying yarn in copious amounts is that one has to schlep it all the way across siberia, or pay loads of money to ship it home. I think I&#8217;m ok with shlepping. At least for now. </p>
<p>So, with that excitement behind us, we boarded the 378 train to Ekaterinburg &#8211; known as Sverdlovsk on the schedules &#8211; it&#8217;s Soviet name. This time, we weren&#8217;t instantly as lucky with great travelling companions. We had two guys &#8211; neither of whom knew each other or spoke english. Neither smiled at all until late the next day. The elder of the two purchased a sweet cake at one of the longer stops and offered to share. And then he smiled and everything was a lot more comfortable. </p>
<p>I am still not used to sleeping fully dressed on the train, especially when it&#8217;s so hot like it&#8217;s been. The one trick that really works for me is to take 2 Tylenol PM before tryin to go to sleep. It knocks me right out and I get a great night&#8217;s sleep. </p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s train should be a bit more comfortable &#8211; it&#8217;s the number 56, and typically anything under 100 is named and considered the &#8220;flagship&#8221; of that particular route. </p>
<p>And if not, even last night was perfectly fine and much better than flying!</p>
<p>So, Ekaterinburg. </p>
<p>Our stay last night was the Academy of Geology Hotel. I predict Geoff will have a knack for describing the feats we went through to find the place, even after we found the building and courtyard it was in! The room was great, with a small fridge, shower, toilet, etc. And it was dead quiet. I think we were the only guests. Must still be the offseason, because we couldn&#8217;t find fault, except for the lack of hot water at night. (I did brave a cold shower last night though. It was worth it. I think.)</p>
<p>After freshening up, we went to a LP recommended restaurant &#8211; Trali-Bali. (It had the distinct advantage of bein 2 blocks from our hotel!). This is probably the first time we really couldn&#8217;t get along without the phrase book, as the menu was entirely in Russian. For some reason, everywhere else has either had photos (like at the Blini stands), or been translated. I&#8217;m proud to say that we managed to order 2 plates of grilled pork and 2 plates of blini with smoked salmon, my new favorite! All the food was incredible, and cheap! I think we paid around $15 each including some beverages. </p>
<p>Today we slept in and headed out at noon for the train station to leave our bags in the left luggage department and find an internet cafe. No luck with the cafe, we are back at the central post office, like in Kazan, with no way to download photos. It&#8217;s now 2pm, which is 2am at home. Sandra is online and we&#8217;ve been trying to get into some chat program for the last hour, it seems. So frustrating to be this close and not be able to communicate!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll finish this entry with one last thought that&#8217;s been on my mind for the past few days. The further east we go, the friendlier we are findin the people. My theory is that some of the encounters we&#8217;ve had in the smaller places were probably equally &#8220;exotic&#8221; for the people we&#8217;ve met locally, since so many fewer Westerners actually come through this way. We&#8217;ve been lucky when we&#8217;ve needed help finding the hotel, etc, to run into people who do speak some English. However, I really wish I had made time for that Russian languae class. Being able to speak more than just the basics for thank you, please, hello, and goodbye, would be nice. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Kazan has been perfect. Bright, blue sky, helpful people everywhere, ice cream on every corner. And it&#8217;s warm without being hot. Absolutely the perfect remedy to Moscow in every way.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0138.JPG' alt='Storytale sunrise' width="300"></a></p>
<p>We arrived early this morning after a near-perfect train ride. We again had only one cabinmate, a girl making her way back to Kazan after being trained near Atlanta for awhile. She had just come off 14 hours of flying to spend another 12 on the train. Her name was Elvira, so the Oak Ridge Boys song was stuck in my head all night!</p>
<p> I have to say, the tea on the train is the best I&#8217;ve ever had. Served in glass and what looks like pewter mugs, it&#8217;s strong, with a LOT of sugar an a LOT of lemon. Incredible, and just the way to start or end a journey. </p>
<p>But I was talking about Kazan. Oh beautiful Kazan. People should write songs about you!</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0137.JPG' alt='The mosque' width="300"></a></p>
<p>The historic, 1000 year old Kremlin was worth seeing, even if only from the outside. They were doing massive construction on the interior so no one was allowed inside the walls. But what a view from outside!@</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0139.JPG' alt='Kremlin from below' width="300"></a></p>
<p>After a busy day of sightseeing, we popped down a tiny alley to find this little cafe. The courtyard felt more like an island than Russia to me. Cute dogs were sleeping in the dirt. The buildings were charismically dilapadated. And the sunshine! Fabulous. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0144.JPG' alt='Caribbean or Russia? You decide.' width="300"></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0141.JPG' alt='Sunny alley' width="300"></a></p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0143.JPG' alt='Friendly little dog' width="300"></a></p>
<p>If I haven&#8217;t mentioned it enough, Baltika is probably the best beverage discovery of the trip so far. Half the price of Coca-cola, each variety of Baltika is numbered, with some stronger than others, some darker than others. It seems to be quite the local favorite, even if it&#8217;s not available everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0146.JPG' alt='Mmm... Baltika' width="300"></a></p>
<p>And, who can resist one last view of the Kremlin before popping onto the night train to Yekaterinburg?</p>
<p><a href="/"><img src='/../../media/IMGA0148.JPG' alt='And, the ever-popular head shot' width="300"></a></p>

<p>We&#8217;re now halfway home. </p>
<p>Sort of. </p>
<p>Ekaterinburg is roughly halfway around the world from Calgary. (It&#8217;s also in Asia &#8212; we crossed the Europe/Asia divide sometime last night or early this moring.) This is as far as we&#8217;re going to get. Now, every step brings us closer to home. </p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 3:22 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Okay, we finally hit the wall. It took us a while. </p>
<p>Kazan is far enough away from Moscow that you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find much English. The most we saw was on the sign at the kremlin. Since English is the official language of the UN, all UNESCO sites have to have signs in English. After that, we were on our own. </p>
<p>Ordering was fun. We&#8217;ve figured out that digging a few key words out of our Russian phrase books helps, as does pointing. Knowing brand names helps, too. And every McDonald&#8217;s seems to have one person who knows English pretty darn well. </p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve already written, Ekaterinburg was fun just finding our hotel. But the fun continued even afterwards. No hot water. After 20 hours on a train and lugging heavy bags around, we needed showers. Cold water doesn&#8217;t make for a good shower. Bleh. The building, for some reason, was also quite cool. Initially, it felt great because we were so hot. Not so much after we cooled down. It seemed heat and hot water weren&#8217;t wholly necessary. We managed to have warm water this morning, though. A few words out of our dictionaries and a few from the attendant&#8217;s managed to solve that problem. </p>
<p>Without question, though, the best experience was ordering dinner last night. The restaurant &#8212; Trolley Bali &#8212; had no English at all, and our server knew less English than we do Russian. We managed to order beer (that much we&#8217;ve picked up) before trying to decipher the menus. It took 20 minutes just to order a pork chop. Food just tastes better when you have to work for it. </p>
<p>This is one of the great things about traveling &#8212; having to adapt to the challenges put before you. Language is only one of them, though it&#8217;s one of the toughest. Russian we&#8217;re not exactly getting the hang of, but it&#8217;s getting easier. By the time we&#8217;re comfortable with it, we&#8217;ll be switching to Mongolian, and then Chinese. </p>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 3:22 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>When the Lonely Planet books fall a little short&#8230; </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the description of the Academy of Geology Hotel here in Ekaterinburg, as provided in the Lonely Planet Trans-Siberian Railway book:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Bldg 6, prosp Lenina 54<br>
Singles/doubles with breakfast $26/30. This is the best budget option with smart, spacious rooms in a quite complex tucked away off the main road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. So let me tell you how we found the place. First of all, we found Lenina Prospekt &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t hard. We walked all the way down to #54 (buildings aren&#8217;t individually numbered here, they go in groups). When you get into cases where buildings are in groups, they&#8217;re numbered something like 54/6 &#8212; such as the building holding our hotel. </p>
<p>Admittedly, I don&#8217;t know what exactly Amy was looking for, but I guess I expected something a little more &#8230; less apartment-y, which is what the 54 block looked like. We found 54/5, but couldn&#8217;t find 54/6. So we started walking around. A kind gentleman, about early 40s, asked us a question. We replied, sheepishly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
ya neh gavaroo pa-rooskie
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you guessed it: &#8220;I don&#8217;t speak Russian.&#8221;</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t stop him, or us, and we proceeded to point, speak slowly (in both languages) until he dug out a map. Turns out that a building in the &#8220;courtyard&#8221; was the one we wanted. The side we could see was partly boarded up and covered in grafitti. We walked around to the other side and found the &#8220;Academy of Geology&#8221; sign, which we could barely read thanks to a Russian trend to use words similar to those in English, but with different spelling. The woman inside was totally unintelligable, and suggested (though her thick, steel bar window) that we should walk around the building. To the grafitti side, it seemed. </p>
<p>Luckily, a boy about 15 years old spoke up &#8212; speaking just enough English to understand that we couldn&#8217;t find the place. Back to the old woman. Conversation, back around to the <em>side</em> (west side, to be specific) of the building to a very unmarked and handle-less door. Pressing a little black buzzer above the door called the attendant, upon which we found out, that yes, this was the place. </p>
<p>For the record, the hotel is fairly nice, but certainly nothing special. So a word of warning to those of you looking for the hotel &#8212; it&#8217;s not clearly marked in the Lonely Planet books, and may require some assistance. </p>

<h2 id="post-77"><a href="/2005/05/12/russian-trains/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Russian trains">Russian trains</a></h2>

<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="/category/russia/index.html" rel="category tag">Russia</a>,<a href="/category/trains/index.html" rel="category tag">Train Stuff</a>,<a href="/category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> &#8212; Geoff @ 2:58 am </div>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>A few of you are probably wondering about the Russian train system. (Okay, I imagine not really <em>wondering</em> about the system, but about why I haven&#8217;t posted anything about it yet.)</p>
<p>I never really got an appreciation for the trains back in 1989, since we were let around by guides. Now that we don&#8217;t have the luxury of someone pointing things out, we&#8217;ve had to figure it out on our own. It&#8217;s not nearly as hard as it might sound, though. </p>
<p>First, the Russian train system has become quite efficient &#8212; even though they&#8217;ve got not even twice the amount of track that Canada has, and a lot more land mass to serve. Schedules are set up so there is buffer time, allowing the trains to meet their scheduled stops regardless of delays. They&#8217;re not high-speed, either &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve topped out at about 100 km/h. (There is a high-speed train, but I have no idea where it runs.)</p>
<p>The first train we took was the ?????? ?????? (pronounced &#8220;krazny strelya&#8221; &#8212; Pavel, please correct me if I got this wrong), which is Russian for &#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;. It&#8217;s Train #1 on the schedules, and runs direct from Moscow to St. Petersburg (and vice-versa, of course, since that&#8217;s how we took it) without stops. It&#8217;s as close to a luxury train as exists here. Since then, we&#8217;ve been on a commuter train (three-person bench seating), Train #28 (Moscow &#8211; Kazan), and Train #378 (Kazan &#8211; Ekaterinburg. </p>
<p>The quality of the trains goes down as the train numbers get larger. </p>
<p>Generally, trains are several cars long &#8212; the longest has been about 19 cars, with the average about 16 or so. There is one electric locomotive at the front that does all the work. I have no idea what the horsepower is on these things, but they do a pretty decent job of hauling. </p>
<p>The cars are all quite heavy, which leads to a decent ride. It&#8217;s helpful that the Russians have replaced tens of thousands of kilometres of track with <acronym title="Continuously Welded Rail">CWR</acronym>, which offers a pretty smooth ride. Much of the replacement looks fairly recent, being within the last few years. There are still lengthy stretches of jointed rail, giving the familiar &#8220;clickety-clack&#8221; as you roll down the line. </p>
<p>Each car is divided into about 10 compartments, each with four bunks. The compartments are roughly 5.5 feet wide, about 6.5 feet long, and 9 feet tall. The bunks are less than two feet wide &#8212; not a lot of room to move. One set faces forward, the other reverse. One bathroom (that we&#8217;ve seen), next to the prahdavista&#8217;s (attendant&#8217;s) cabin, has a toilet that dumps onto the tracks with a sink. There&#8217;s a samovar for hot water nearby. If you&#8217;re lucky, you can convince the attendant to lower windows to keep the temperature down in the cars. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03555.JPG" width="300" alt="Amy in the Red Arrow"></a></p>
<p>Bedrolls are rented when staying overnight for between 30 and 60 rubles, depending on phase of the moon (or some such unrelated factor). Sheets, thankfully, are delivered (upon paying the fee), clean and sealed in a plastic bag. </p>
<p>The attendant will notify you when your stop is coming up, in case you&#8217;re not going to the end of the line. Handy, since sometimes it&#8217;s hard to know where you are. Kilometres are marked, but unless you&#8217;ve got a rail chart (which we don&#8217;t), it&#8217;s hard to know where you are. </p>
<p>And for some goofy reason, all the trains run off of Moscow standard time, even though the stations are local time. I will never understand that one. </p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Okay, a HUGE thumbs up to Kazan. Wow. Such an amazing little city. I&#8217;m sure Kazan itself is quite large, but the &#8220;main&#8221; area is surprisingly compact yet still very revealing. It is simply too bad that we were only there for the day &#8212; two days should be the required minimum for a stay there. </p>
<p>After my stupidly short posting, Amy and I went to hang out in a park for a while, just to watch the city from a distance. Then it was down to the Central Market. The intention had been to buy food for the trip to Ekaterinburg. However, Amy found a stall selling (what she believes is) wool yarn. And lots of it. Cheap. </p>
<p>I really wish I&#8217;d captured her exchange on film. She had to find a way to explain the concept of two-ply yarn to the vendor. Eventually, they figured it out and Amy walked away with 10 balls of the stuff. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have to carry that, but she&#8217;s going to need to ship something home before too long&#8230;</p>
<p>The trip to Ekaterinburg was hot. We were in a room with two quiet guys who didn&#8217;t particularly thrill either Amy or myself. Thankfully, not drunkards, though. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been fearing running into. I&#8217;ve been practicing saying &#8220;I&#8217;m an alcoholic&#8221; because it&#8217;s apparently the only way to avoid being nagged into doing vodka shots. </p>
<p>Now to explore Ekaterinburg!</p>

<p>We arrived in Kazan early this morning. I awoke with the sunrise, watching it through the train&#8217;s window.  It&#8217;s already 20+ degrees here, which is great for sightseeing. Although unlike Amy, I do find it quite hot. </p>
<p>Kazan&#8217;s the capital of Tatarstan (home of Tartar sauce?), a not-quite-yet breakaway republic of Russia. It&#8217;s about the same size as Calgary, but sits on the banks of a much larger river &#8212; the Volga. It&#8217;s both a very old city (over 1,000 years!) but also new &#8212; they&#8217;re building/rebuilding quite a lot here. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03560.JPG" width="300" alt="Amy in front of the Kazan kremlin"></a></p>
<p>This is truly a wonderful city. It&#8217;s warm, comfortable, and people are far too nice here. Despite not knowing any Russian, we&#8217;ve had next to no trouble at all getting help from everyone around us. A person not knowing the language at all would do well here. </p>
<p>Time&#8217;s running out for me on this post, though &#8212; internet is hard to find here today. More from Ekaterinburg!</p>
<p>(Next time, I get to post before Amy&#8230;)</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve wandered a lot through Moscow, and I never did get around to talking about it due to all the bitching I was doing. So&#8230; We took Train #1 t Moscow, did a walk around the Kremlin, saw the Armoury museum (snore), walked through GUM, and revelled in the &#8220;marvel&#8221; that is our hotel. When not being watched by the hundreds of security guards, that is&#8230;</p>
<p>The GUM department store used to be a haven for long lines for toilet paper. Now it&#8217;s a haven for corporate America:</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Amy. </p>
<p>Moscow is dismal. Even when it&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s dismal. There is just no joy or life in this city. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a result of decades of Soviet rule, but I can&#8217;t wait to get out of here. I suppose the plethora of security personnel doesn&#8217;t help, either. </p>
<p>Amy and I escaped to the <a href="http://www.musobl.divo.ru/archit_e.html">monastery at Sergei Posad</a>, a small town about 90 minutes east of Moscow. It was a great chance to escape to something a little more sane. The monastery is an operating one &#8212; and has been that way since it was first founded. Even Stalin didn&#8217;t touch it (and he was famous for destroying churches just for the fun of it). </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03557.JPG" width="300" alt="The monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)"></a></p>
<p>It looked almost the same as it had in 1989, though some of the buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. (Apparently, prayer is more important than keeping a roof over one&#8217;s head.) Unlike many of the other places we&#8217;ve been, though, the only fee at the monastery is to allow you to take photos or use a video camera (a common fee, mind you &#8212; a lot of places have it). A lot of people were there &#8212; a single ruble from each of them would go a long way to ensuring the funding of the monastery. </p>
<p><a href="/"><img src="/media/DSC03558.JPG" width="300" alt="Me in front of the monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a McDonald&#8217;s in Sergei Posad, now, about 250 metres from the monastery. There&#8217;s just something wrong about that. </p>
<p>The tourist-only Berioska Shop that was on the outskirts of the plaza is gone, replaced with a series of small stores and a restaurant. The building is ringed by local vendors hawking their local wares (though I suspect a number of them are made in China). </p>
<p>The food, as Amy has pointed out, has generally been quite good. Although Russian cuisine isn&#8217;t quite as &#8220;neat&#8221; as North American. You have to be careful eating chicken &#8212; they don&#8217;t debone it, here. Georgian cuisine is very tasty, although spicy, and a little bit greasy. </p>
<p>We leave in about five hours, and it can&#8217;t go fast enough. I want out of here. I want to get on the road. I want to get past Moscow and into areas I don&#8217;t know. I want to head in the direction of home. Amy and I are homesick (Amy&#8217;s also actually sick, and I really hope I don&#8217;t catch her cold), so the sooner we get moving, the better. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, we&#8217;ll be in Kazan. There for the day, then off to Ekaterinburg. </p>
